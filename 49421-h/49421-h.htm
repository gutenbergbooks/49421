<p>When great historians with their learned
pens shall come to set forth the complete story
of the most sweeping and horrible war the
world has ever known, I figure they may perhaps
have need of such evidence, information
and material as a man like myself can give. I
mean a man who has been through the red
hell of the vast conflict in places where it has
flamed most fiercely, a soldier who has been
eye-witness of its superb heroisms, its stupendous
tragedies, scientific marvels, has undergone
its tense emotional and psychological experiences,
bears on his body its wounds, has seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
first hand with the amazement all civilization
has felt, the cowardice, bestiality, utter moral
abandonment to which a nation may fall in a
mad dream of the conquest of the world.</p>

<p>My name is David Fallon. I am of the
County Mayo, Ireland. And I’d ask your pardon
for a word or two by way of boasting in
stating that my ancestors for a pretty-long journey
back into history, have always figured in the
man-sized battles of their generations. My
father, a naturalist, rushed away from gentle
scientific pursuits in 1870 to bear arms for
France against the Prussians. And it isn’t only
because I’m Irish that I fought to get into this
present big fight&mdash;and I did fight to get into it&mdash;but
for the pertinent and additional reason
that it was in France father met Mlle. Sarah
Voltaire who not very long thereafter became
Mrs. Fallon.</p>

<p>And small wonder, with my boy’s mind stirred
so many an evening by the exciting stories of the
Franco-Prussian battles my father and mother
would tell us of in the glow of the old library
fireplace, that I had no trouble electing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
course of my life. I left the University of
Dublin to enlist in the British army. I joined
a Northumberland regiment, Nov. 19, 1904,
and the military examiners were not at first
quite so enthusiastic about the performance
as I was for I offered them no Hercules. I was
then only eighteen years old, a little under
medium height and slim as a whalebone. A
weighing machine as far as I was concerned
escaped with the small effort of marking one
hundred and ten pounds. But I was sound of
eye, tooth, blood and heart and so they cordially
handed me my uniform&mdash;even if they did
have to trim off the sleeves of the tunic a bit.</p>

<p>It is only fair I should say for myself that I
was a rather good boy&mdash;that the temptations
besetting youths in the army have never left
their marks on me. Not, believe me, that I
was a sanctimonious kid&mdash;a good many miles
away from that. But I was lucky in having a
keen love of athletics and a pride of achievement
in many branches of sport. There’s nothing
like such a disposition to keep a boy clean
and straight. Soccer, Rugby, swimming, wrestling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
running&mdash;the opportunity for such games
and contests was constant in the army and made
me devoted to military life.</p>

<p>And boxing! Good heavens, the whalings
I took! But by the same token, the whalings
I handed out! There is no use my telling myself
that just about here I should be content
to hide my light under a bushel somewhat. I’ll
not do it. The fact is I rose to the dizzy
splendor of champion featherweight of the
British Army in India.</p>

<p>Just a few words more in order to place myself
at the time when the vast war began. I
saw brief, uneventful service in China, then
spent years in India, took part in many of the
“hills scraps,” sporadic uprisings of the mountain
tribes, dangerous and exciting enough encounters
we regarded them then, petty memories
now; stood before Lord Minto, then Viceroy,
in Calcutta, 1908, and received from him
the Indian Frontier medal, was promoted to
sergeant-major and with the rank of staff sergeant
major was detailed to the Royal Military
Academy at Dunstroon, New South Wales, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
instructor in athletics, general physical exercises,
deportment and bayonet drill. This was my
station when Germany began its brutal attack
upon its neighbors.</p>

<p>And let me say right here that while in any
event Australia would have made a sturdy response
to Britain’s call, what Germany can put
into its long-stemmed, china-bowled pipe and
“smoke it,” is that were it not for the appalling,
cowardly, barbarous crimes committed against
the defenseless&mdash;the women and children of
Belgium, there would never have been, as there
has been, such tremendous outpouring of fighting
men from splendid Australia; 400,000 of
them out of a population of men, women and
children numbering 5,000,000! All volunteers,
you understand? It is the volunteer record of
the war&mdash;not forgetting Canada’s mighty showing
of 550,000 out of a population of 7,000,000!</p>

<p>It was not until Germany gave atrocious evidences
of her disregard of humanity, not until
its army had stalked in its giant size, a red-stained,
moral idiot, through little Belgium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
crucifying old men and women and children to
the doors of their homes, ravishing girls and
women, murdering the parents who tried to
protect them; not until this enormity of degeneracy
had passed into the history of mankind,
did Australia take fire.</p>

<p>I know because at the very beginning of the
war I was sent out to Sydney and Melbourne
as a whip for enlistment&mdash;made scores of
speeches daily in halls, parks, street corners and
other public places. My hearers were many and
they were earnest and thoughtful but deliberate
as well. Enlistments came and numerously but
not with anything approaching a rush. Your
prospective soldier debated a good deal with his
own personal interests, before he signed up.</p>

<p>But after Belgium! The crowds I addressed
took the arguments for enlistment away from
me&mdash;made the talk themselves, swarmed to
join. Social ranks broke completely and almost
instantaneously. Everybody flocked to
the army&mdash;artists, actors, lawyers, merchants,
clerks, larrikins, miners and the men from the
vast, open places of Australia.</p>

<div id="ip_6" class="figcenter" style="width: 612px;"><img src="images/i_fp_006.jpg" width="612" height="410" alt="" /><div class="caption">“British blood is calling British blood”</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Brothers are these last in every degree of
character to the American and Canadian miners,
ranchers, trappers, cowboys; they are big,
lean, brave, boyishly chivalrous men, shy of
women but adoring them, willing to play romping
dog any old time to win the smile of a child
or the pat of its little hand.</p>

<p>It must stand as one of the most picturesque
features of the war&mdash;the great distances these
men traveled to the centers of population to
offer their services to avenge the slaughter of
the helpless in Belgium and to fight for the
honor, prestige and life of the Gray Mother
of the Empire.</p>

<p>Take for instance, John Wilson, gold prospector.
He came out of the wilderness, fifteen
hundred miles to Sydney, to join the colors;
four hundred of it on horseback, one hundred
of it literally hacking his way through a dense,
trackless forest of giant gum and eucalyptus
trees until he got to Bourke, whence, once
a fortnight, a train leaves for Sydney. Thousands
and thousands of John Wilsons made
their way to the cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
And from the distant islands of the Archipelago&mdash;Samoa,
Fiji, Cocos, Madras, when the
news of Germany’s infamy seeped into the men
far in the interiors&mdash;the traders and planters
in oils and nuts, the hunters of birds of paradise&mdash;they
came out through the swamps, paddled
their way on jungle rivers laboriously
but tirelessly, determinedly to the coast and put
themselves aboard the first ships obtainable.
There occurred at this time a great shortage in
crews for these ships, so that some were threatened
with being held up for days or weeks for
lack of men. Many well-to-do patriots, amply
supplied with funds to meet the expense of a
trip in the first cabin, signed up as stokers, seamen
or deck-hands in order to expedite the journeys
from the islands to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne
or other coast communities where they
might join the army.</p>

<p>And the larrikins, the hooligans, “hard guys”
of the cities, gangsters, youths and men of lives
abandoned to drink, drugs and other vices&mdash;Germany’s
unspeakable cruelty in Belgium even
stung such as these out of their indifference. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the early days of enlistment we had managed to
win precious few of this class to the service.
The majority of them had been sullen and derisive
to our appeals to join the colors.</p>

<p>“Wot’s all this flaming war about, anywye?
Blast the blooming war, I ain’t got nothin’ to
fight about.”</p>

<p>That had been the characteristic response.</p>

<p>But the piteous images of children with
bleeding, severed throats, of tiny human bodies
dismembered, of decent girls and women subject
to the foulest acts of vicious cowardice, sent
the larrikins to us seething with rage and resolved,
as it was especially hard for men of this
sort to resolve, to accept the strict discipline of
army life for the chance to spill the blood of
the horror-makers of Europe.</p>

<p>As to these same larrikins, if you please, I
would like to set down some more. Scrubby
they came to us, most of them, pallid, undersized,
some of them wretchedly nervous from
drinks, drugs, under-feeding, bad teeth, all manner
of irregularities of life due to poverty, due
to vice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
But, “by the living God that made” them,
once you’d repaired them&mdash;fixed their teeth, fed
them, exercised them, made bathing instead of
a drunk a daily habit with them, once, in short,
that you’d properly set them up and, excuse the
emphasis, but they made the damnedest best soldiers
of the lot.</p>

<p>Not that the professional men, business men,
open-air men who went into the ranks were not
as heroic. A hundred incidents of the splendor
of bravery that men of all classes displayed
crowd my memory to take swift, sharp issue
with the idea. But you see the larrikin&mdash;the
designation used to be one of contempt with me
but is something pretty close to affection now
and I should say with several other thousands
of officers as well&mdash;comes to you with the devil’s
own experience of hard-knocks. He knows hunger,
thirst, the misery of cold, of pains and
aches he has no doctor to allay. And I would
point out that one of these boys who has survived
such conditions with a physique left good
enough to get him into the army, must have
started life with the flesh and blood make-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
akin to the steel armor-plates and entrails of
a dreadnaught. So when you take him and give
him only half a brushing-up, the readiness of
his response would (may I borrow the expression
of an Ally?) certainly jar you. His face
gets pink, his chest sticks out, the sneer he wore
becomes a smile, the contemptible trickery he
used to work turns to good-natured, practical
jokes. He is childishly amazed to find that his
comrades&mdash;the man who was a lawyer at home,
or the other who was a tradesman or the very
wonderful person who was a well-known feature
in vaudeville and even&mdash;Gawd blime me!
his captain likes him. And once he believes
that&mdash;knows it and feels it then (another draft
on an Ally) you’ve “got something!” The very
gang training he has had when he banded with
his pals to fight and cheat the law, that gang
spirit with all its blind devotion is at the nod of
his officer. He’ll go to hell for you even when
he knows there is not much or any chance of
coming back, and if all of his kind, whether out
of Whitechapel, the purlieus of Canadian cities
or the slums of Australia who have done that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
very thing of going into hell and not come back,
might be called on parade it would be a big
procession. Yet not of grief-stricken or agonized
men but they who walk with fine, clear,
steady eyes, and countenances wonderfully
cleansed.</p>

<p>To move a little ahead of that day in a then
fast-approaching October when the first twenty-thousand
of us sailed away to get into the big
muss, I’d like to tell a little story of the only
larrikin I know of who fell flatly down on his
job.</p>

<p>They had made him, to his fierce disgust, the
Lord high keeper of a carrier pigeon. He was
a person who wanted to get into the fight&mdash;Anzac
for Boche, yes, two Boches or three. But
here he had been made custodian of the carrier
pigeon. He had never had a chance at a Boche.
He must trail his officer at the rear of charging
men. He must have the pigeon in its little box
ready, so that should the officer command, the
pigeon could have a neat little message as to
reinforcements or success tied to his little leg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
be released from the box when he would shoot
up straight as an arrow above the roar and
smoke of battle and home his way to the rear,
dropping into a box at the commandant’s trench
or dug-out station and when he dropped into
the box causing a very sharp toned little bell to
ring&mdash;a tone so sharp as to cut through the
thunder of guns.</p>

<p>Well, one night on such a charge the officer
missed his larrikin and not long afterward the
pigeon for whom the larrikin had so long been
valet, plopped into his little box at the commandant’s
dug-out, making the sharp gong
clang incisively. The battle was roaring fearfully,
but the commandant got the ring, retrieved
the pigeon, slipped the little message
roll off its slender leg, spread the message,
swore first and then laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” his aide asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I should,” said the commandant, “have him
arrested and shot, but I don’t think I will.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Capt. &mdash;&mdash;’s larrikin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Look at the message he’s sent by the
pigeon.”</p>

<p>The aide read a message written in the heat
of the engagement, but with the stencil-neatness
that larrikins acquire in the military schools:</p>

<p>“I am tired of carrying this dam bird and
have gone into the fite.”</p>

</div>

<p>That carrier-pigeon soldier had my sympathy
for I had undergone his same sensation of
exasperation at the very beginning of things.
This was when I heard back in August, 1914,
that because of proficiency as physical instructor
and drill master, it was the intention of my
superiors to keep me at post at the Royal Military
College at Dunstroon in New South Wales&mdash;keep
me there to fit other men to go into the
fight. I am no bloodthirsty demon and I am
no brother to the Hun, but having been a professional
soldier all my life what could you expect
me to be but hopping mad when it would
appear that I wasn’t going to get in the greatest
fight of history, when it looked as if all of
the huge, smashing fight I would see would be
from the side-lines? Surely that would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
great deal like asking a prize-fighter to accept
a job as a dancing master!</p>

<p>Well, I was Irish enough to battle for what
I considered my rights. I kicked strenuously.
These kicks got something of sympathy from
my immediate superiors and so found their way
higher until finally I was in actual correspondence
in the matter with Mr. Pierce, Australia’s
Minister of Defense. To him I set forth my
case vigorously and often and if he was, perhaps,
somewhat amused at my insistence he was
just enough to take into consideration the good
points I offered for myself, my long service, my
Indian Frontier medal, and in the end, to accept
my own estimate, that I would be of
greater value handling men on the actual front
than being school master to the rookies at home.
There were among the professional soldiers, I
further pointed out to him, older men as able
as I in training men and who had families dependent
upon them, whereas I was not then
thirty years old, and possessed no close family
connections who would suffer materially if I
should go the way that so many splendid, brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
officers and men of my country and of France
had already traveled&mdash;to the hospitals, the
German prison camps or those rough-and-readily
builded, nobly impressive, shell-swept graveyards
which had come to existence in France.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps, had I been clairvoyant, had I
been able to see ahead what was shortly to
come&mdash;the savage, awful experience in Gallipoli,
the murderous, weary days and nights in
Flanders and the Somme, the long suffering,
the tremendous scientific ferocity of it all, well,
perhaps I might not have tried so hard to bring
the Minister of Defense to my way of thinking.
And, yet, while ducking the appellation
of hero as I would duck a Boche bomb, after
all, I think that with present knowledge of
what comes to a man in this great war and
what can come to him, I would still have tried
for my chance to play my part in the great
game. What soldier worth the name would
not?</p>

<p>Well, soon enough there came a day that
found us&mdash;the First Division of the Australian
Expeditionary Force&mdash;on our way. We had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
clear idea of whither we were bound. We
thought for the most part that we were going
straight to the fighting in France. There were
thirty transports in all. My own crowd, about
twelve hundred strong, were aboard the <i>Themistocles</i>,
a converted White Star Liner that
formerly traveled between Australian ports
and Aberdeen, Scotland, a goodly-sized ship she
was of 13,000 tons. From every other port of
size in Australia other troopships had come
laden. At Sydney the entire thirty were mobilized
and with the Australian fleet comprising
some of Britain’s greatest dreadnaughts, a complement
of Japanese destroyers and a French
cruiser or two we set forth on fairly smooth
seas.</p>

<p>At all the ports where the populace got hints
of the time of sailing of the ships there were
great demonstrations and likewise impromptu
demonstrations of liveliest enthusiasm met us
whenever we appeared parading on the streets,
to say nothing of the crowds that came to cheer
us at drill in our camps.</p>

<p>For by October, Australia had come to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
how tremendous and frightful a war Germany
had planned, how viciously and hatefully Germany
had resolved to strike at the very life of
the British Empire and Australia began to realize
that if the British Empire went under, she
herself would eventually have the Hun at her
own throat.</p>

<p>It wasn’t only the news of the mammoth operations
which had started in Europe that
brought this realization. Things had happened
“at home.” The German propaganda secretly,
maliciously taking advantage of a democratic
country’s open hospitality, had effected bomb
outrages, and worked insidiously to bring about
strikes in the coal and iron mines and strikes on
the railroads, had worked the same despicable
“below the belt” tactics in the Archipelago as
she has in America. And the cables were constantly
bringing news of fresh, cowardly outrages
upon the old, and the women and the
children of Belgium!</p>

<p>The firmness of Australia’s premier, the effectiveness
of Australia’s police in its cities and
of the Government’s secret agents as well (once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the German propagandists had revealed their
hands) soon began securely to tie these same
hands of the promoters of German frightfulness.
But the people by this time had been
worked to a towering rage and as we started
away in our troopships, great crowds in the
cities were riotously asserting their resentment.
They wrecked scores of German shops, battered
them into ruins and put them to the torch.</p>

<p>With none of us knowing that Gallipoli was
ahead we settled down to make our ocean voyage.
Where&mdash;we didn’t know at the time it
was to take us, but we did make it as enjoyable
as might be in crowded bunks and where we
were forever touching elbows on the jammed
decks. Men never sailed on an expedition
of war in better spirits and greater confidence.
The regular soldiers and amateur soldiers were
about evenly divided, but the amateurs were
swiftly coming into line in physical fitness and
expertness in drill. Still there were some funny
incidents due to the novelty of the life that
many of our men were leading. As for instance,
a little deck sentry, whom I approached one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and who looked at me and said: “Are you an
officer?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell that from my uniform?” I
said, nodding toward the sergeant-major’s
chevrons on my arm.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” he said, suiting the action of
the word, “I suppose I will have to chuck you
a blooming salute.”</p>

<p>We got together for all kinds of athletic
fun&mdash;wrestling, potato and wheel-barrow
races, running races, but principally the sport
was boxing. Then there were serious-minded
men who liked the sports all right, but organized
a sort of debating society. There
were no lack of interesting principals for this
organization. There were professors from the
Australian universities, Captain Knyvett for example,
who had been the professor of psychology
at the University of Brisbane, and there
were scores of his class. The debating club discussed
everything from Sanskrit to how to fry
an egg or bayonet a Boche.</p>

<p>One of two great excitements of our journey
was furnished by “Bushy Bill,” a reckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
larrikin of Melbourne. Bushy declared
one evening a few minutes after dark that he
could do something that would stop the whole
fleet. We asked him what his little notion
might be, but he declined to tell. He said, however,
that he was willing to wager a pound that
he could succeed in his threat. Somebody took
him up and the instant he did so “Bushy Bill”
put up his pound note and also pressed into the
hand of a friend all other money and valuables
that he had in his pockets and without another
word, hopped over the taffrail and into the sea.
Naturally the cry went up immediately of “Man
overboard!” Noisy signals were exchanged between
ships of the fleet, searchlights began to
play widely in all directions, and afterward we
learned that in every other ship of the fleet,
where like ourselves everybody was on tenterhooks
in expectancy of a raider’s attack, the
<i>Emden</i> possibly, orders were swiftly signaled
for the ships to deploy. The <i>Themistocles</i>
stopped and backed. Meanwhile, two soldiers
had gone over the side for the rescue of “Bill,”
believed to have been suddenly stricken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
insanity. Following the two men who plowed
through the waves to his rescue, a boat was
lowered.</p>

<p>Bill was all laughter and excitement when
he was hauled aboard, enthusiastically claiming
to have won his bet, which was promptly
paid, but then Bill did some prompt paying.
This was in the way of entering on a six-months’
sentence in the brig, which held him
for weeks also in the guard house when our
division got to Egypt.</p>

<p>Only the next day came a more thrilling
event. This was when our wireless told us
that the depredations of the vicious raider, the
<i>Emden</i>, had been brought at Cocos Island to
a swift end by the <i>Sydney</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, there was tremendous rejoicing.
On all the boats, at all the “parades” (the assembling
of the soldiers for afternoon drill),
the news of the sinking of the <i>Emden</i> by the
<i>Sydney</i> was “read out.” Commanders made no
effort to stifle the cheers that arose.</p>

<p>One of the boys composed a parody on “Tipperary”
to celebrate the event, which we sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
with greatest vim and vigor all the way to Gallipoli
and afterward. It was worded this way:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“It’s a long, long way to Cocos Island,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">It’s a long way to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was there the <i>Sydney</i> met the <i>Emden</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">And made old Kaiser Bill swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s a long, long way to Cocos Island,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">But the <i>Sydney</i> boys got there!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>You can imagine that aboard this crowded
ship, with men of all types and character, and
with all the rough play aboard, that it would not
be just the sort of a place for a girl. Yet we
had one aboard. We didn’t know it for some
time after we were out, because little Betty
Grainger, in devotion to her sweetheart, had
not only cut off her long, golden locks, but had
deliberately roughened her hands with toil, the
more to make good her disguise as a boy. Somewhere
she had secured a uniform. In those days
the uniforms were of all manner of irregularities;
anything in a color and shade of khaki
would serve. The very style of military uniform
belted with a skirt effect of the coat and
loose riding breeches would enable a girl to
successfully disguise herself. Betty did until one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
night when the men were playing a romping
game of “tilt the cart,” wherein your idea was
principally to upset your neighbor by a quick
grasp of the legs and a heave of him over
your shoulder. When an unsuspecting rookie
grabbed Betty and sought to “tilt the cart”
she uttered a most unmanly scream. The men
gathered around to further “rag” this effeminate
boy when Betty gave further evidence of
her real sex by bursting into tears and scratching
their faces. And then “Long Jack” Kennedy,
of Melbourne, suddenly sailed into the
men surrounding her, forgetting the camouflage
that Betty sought to enact, picked her up in
his arms and faced the crowd with an outburst
of oaths. That settled it. Betty, who had
registered as George Grainger, was known for
what she was. But even the authorities of
the ship felt no bitterness toward Betty. She
was given over to the care of a company of
nurses aboard the <i>Themistocles</i>, and tried very
hard to make herself useful, but because of
the deception she had practiced the commander
ordered her put off at Perth.</p>

<p>We had a short stop and walk around Colombo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and then at Suez. Four days later found
us in an even stranger environment for Australians.
We had landed at Cairo&mdash;the first
Australian Expeditionary force, part of General
Birdwood’s Division which besides our contingent,
comprised the 29th English Division
(regulars). The Zion Mule Corps, a detachment
of French troops, four regiments of
Ghurkas, several native Indian regiments and
the Indian Supply and Transport corps. Although
no efforts were made to put up barracks
or permanent buildings, it was soon evident
that we were to be kept in our Egyptian camp
for some period of time. The magnitude of
the commissary arrangements, the settlements
of the regiments into a general plan of a large
and permanent encampment, made this only too
plain. We had all been hoping and cheering
for our advent to France. At this time we
were, as I believe, merely held by Lord
Kitchener to further our training. For the
conquest of Gallipoli&mdash;that red hell of disaster&mdash;was
not in the books of our commanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
German propaganda of the foulest and most
awful sort swiftly made its appearance at Cairo.
German agents (medical men in this case) we
were afterward to learn, had gone among the
women of the port, and advised them for their
own protection to submit to inoculations that
would armor them against the advent of the
great thousands of soldiers. They were told
the Australians would of a certainty spread a
strange and deadly plague. In reality these
agents inoculated the women with the most
awful disease, and in this way laid a plot of
destruction against our forces, which I am sorry
to say met with some degree of success before
the discovery of the infernal plan.</p>

<p>Moreover, German propagandists had corrupted
countless of the proprietors of the small
resorts where liquor and gambling were to be
found, had instilled all the inhabitants and
keepers of bazaars in the native village of
Cairo with ideas of secret assassination of our
men for gain. Also after the arrival of our soldiers
these insidious workers did all they could
to promote an enmity between the natives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the Anzacs. The result of this campaign was
nearly as sinister as that of the inoculation of
the women. Our men on leave were drugged
and secretly murdered, their bodies made away
with, with a skill that defeated all efforts at
tracing the crimes. It is a fact that at least two
hundred and fifty of the first division of Anzacs
encamped at Cairo never returned to their regiments,
and no trace of what had befallen them,
which doubtless was most sinister, has ever
come to our exact knowledge to this very
day. So thoroughly had the natives been
instilled with an enmity toward us that the atmosphere
and conditions between us became intolerable.
The natives assumed a surly and
insulting aspect toward us, and we in turn, I
presume, swaggered and frowned and treated
them with growing sharpness. With the full
extent of the villainy that had been plotted and
achieved against us in the matter of afflicting
hundreds of our men with horrible disease and
of assassinating fully two hundred and fifty
others, there came a night when resentment
burst forth among a large company of the Anzacs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and took the shape of a fierce, violent and
deadly reprisal.</p>

<p>The men secretly collected, armed themselves
with revolvers, secured paraffin and oil
torches, and some even took up bombs.</p>

<p>They rushed through the native section of the
city especially among its disreputable resorts,
and did their utmost to destroy it utterly by the
flames of their torches, and where resistance
was met, did not hesitate to use their fire-arms
and bombs to kill. It was a night of horror in
Cairo. But the crimes against us had been more
terrible than the revenge. This summary and
deadly action discredited the secret German
agents and their influence and brought about
from the natives a subserviency and desire to
propitiate the Anzacs equal to their attitude of
enmity before. It was a drastic measure that
was taken, but under the circumstances, it may
be left to the judgment of the reader as to its
justification.</p>

<p>There was intensive drilling in our cantonment,
called Mena Camp, near the Pyramids of
Gizeh, but just the same we found time for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
indulgence in many sports, especially horse racing,
camel and donkey riding, hunts for buried
treasure among the sacred tombs of the
ancients, and one party of the boys really returned
to camp with a genuine mummy for a
prize.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, life became monotonous
and we were all anxious and alert for an opportunity
to show ourselves in the fighting. It was
coming soon enough, though we didn’t exactly
know it then. But we realized that action was
soon to begin for us when 10,000 men&mdash;500 of
my own attachment aboard the <i>Euripides</i>, set
sail under a convoy of twenty war ships, including
the great <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, <i>Prince of Wales</i>,
<i>Tiger</i>, <i>Triumph</i> and French boats in the early
part of April, for Lemnos Island in the Greek
Archipelago. The physical aspects of this
country were nearly identical with those we
were to meet in the landing of Gallipoli. There
was a vast promontory coming down to open
water, always at a tempestuous degree, and
there we went into a new form of intensive
training. This consisted of lowering the boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in the choppy, stormy waters, landing the boats
in the perilous surf, wading to our knees in
water, swimming under the burden of our knapsacks,
making numerous landings, digging ourselves
in, and target practice at imaginary Turkish
batteries, the real character of the batteries
at Gallipoli having been discovered and reported
by efficient British and French spies.
When we were ready this was the order that
came to us from our Commander, General W.
R. Birdwood:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center large">LANDING ORDERS.</p>

<p class="center larger"><span class="smcap">Australian New Zealand Army Corps.</span></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Officers and Men</span>: <span class="in2">April 1915.</span></p>

<p>In conjunction with the Navy, we are about
to undertake one of the most difficult tasks any
soldier can be called to perform, and a problem
which has puzzled many soldiers for years past.
That we will succeed I have no doubt, simply
because I know your full determination to do so.
Lord Kitchener has told us that he lays special
stress on the rôle the Army has to play in this
particular operation, the success of which will
be a very severe blow to the enemy indeed, as
severe as any he could receive in France. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
go down in history to the glory of the soldiers
of Australia and New Zealand. Before we
start, there are one or two points which I must
impress on all, and I most earnestly beg every
single man to listen attentively and take them
to heart.</p>

<p>We are going to have a real hard and rough
time of it until, at all events, we have turned
the enemy out of the first objective. Hard,
rough times none of us mind, but to get through
them successfully we must always keep before
us the following facts: Every possible endeavor
will be made to bring up transport as often as
possible; but the country whither we are bound
is very difficult, and we may not be able to get
our wagons anywhere near us for days, so men
must not think their wants have been neglected
if they do not get all they want. On landing it
will be necessary for every individual to carry
with him all his requirements in food and clothing
for three days, as we may not see our transport
again till then. Remember then that it is
essential for everyone to take the very greatest
care not only of his food, but of his ammunition
the replenishment of which will be very difficult.
Men are liable to throw away their food first
day out and to finish their water bottles as soon
as they start marching. If you do this now, we
can hardly hope for success, as unfed men cannot
fight, and you must make an effort to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and refrain from starting on your water bottles
until quite late in the day. Once you begin drinking
you cannot stop, and a water bottle is very
soon emptied.</p>

<p>Also as regards ammunition&mdash;you must not
waste it by firing away indiscriminately at no
target. The time will come when we shall find
the enemy in well-entrenched positions, from
which we shall have to turn them out, when all
our ammunition will be required; and remember,</p>

<p>I am here reminded of an incident regarding

a smile in it for the reader.</p>

<p>The Australians or Anzacs took pride in distinguishing
themselves by the wearing of an emu
feather (the feather of their native bird) in
their caps. No Anzac was happy without an
emu feather in his cap. I have already said
how willing and anxious the Australians were
to make good in their military duties, but how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
hard it was for them to enter strictly into the
conduct demanded by militarism.</p>

<p>A certain sentry didn’t salute General Birdwood,
who at that time wore no emu feather in
his hat, an omission the Australians resented.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir,” demanded General
Birdwood, “by not saluting me? Do you know
who I am?”</p>

<p>“No, who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am Birdwood.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the sentry, without any loss of
his own dignity, “why don’t you wear a feather
in your cap as a bird would?”</p>

<p>The general stared hard at the man for an
instant, tried to frown, but laughed instead, and
there was no court martial.</p>

<p>Today all is quiet at Gallipoli Peninsula.
The rows on rows of wooden crosses at Anzac
and Helles, at Nibrunsei Point and Brighton
Beach, look out over the Ægean Sea, doubtless
blue as it ever was. The dead who lie beneath
these little monuments of great deeds&mdash;the
crosses amid the dwarf holly bushes that clothe
the western slopes&mdash;have reached their rest. In
the scrub Lee-Enfields lie rusting alongside
shattered Mausers. The pebbles on the long
bleak beaches are mixed with shrapnel bullets,
and in the sand and the dunes west of the Long
Sap are buried bones and scraps of leather,
clips of corroded cartridges, and shreds of
khaki clothing.</p>

<p>We had no false idea when we left Lemnos
Island, eight transports carrying our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
particular 3,000 Australians, twelve more carrying
the remainder of General Birdwood’s
division, as to the difficulty if not impossibility
of the task ahead. Our training at Lemnos
Island had shown some of the difficulties, especially
the business of landing through choppy
seas or narrow beaches under frowning cliffs and
then scaling those cliffs. The Turks with their
German officers had had their warning in the
attempt to force the Dardenelles by the allied
forces in January. It was absurd to think that
they would be surprised by any movement we
could make only a few months after. We discussed
the improbability of success quite openly.
We went over the old defeats in the history of
the Dardenelles, the defeats when Helen of
Troy figured as the object of conquest, the defeats
of the Crusaders and of Constantine. As
I say, we didn’t have much hope, but nevertheless,
we were all glad that the time had come
when the training was at an end and we were
to go into the fight. Personally, I set about the
same task as the others. On the eve of the battle
I wrote to my solicitors, Garland, Seabourne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
&amp; Abbott, as to the disposal of an insurance
policy I had. I had no wife, sweetheart or parents
and decided to make an old and pretty-crusty
uncle of mine in England&mdash;he had given
me a whaling or two when I was a boy&mdash;the
beneficiary.</p>

<p>I had gathered before leaving Australia
ostrich and emu plumes and had made photographs
of my companions, had purchased in
Egypt the pretty little flower books made up in
their pages of pressed flowers, had acquired
sandal boxes, silk handkerchiefs and quite a
quantity of “Turkish delight,” as we always
spoke of our tobacco. I made up many little
packages as mementos to girls I knew, to
friends, and in common with the others gave
them over to the postal clerk of the <i>Euripides</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, the world knows the fate of the
<i>Euripides</i>, and so my will and all my packages
of gifts and letters never reached their destination.
But after the men had made these final
dispensations of their little properties, had
written their private secret hopes, fears, and
expressions of affection to loved ones, the sadness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of that period swiftly passed from us and
we began to laugh and joke at the prospect of
what was ahead. We even went so far as to
make a sweepstake to be won by the first man
to land on the Peninsula. We came to anchor
at, I should say, about two o’clock in the morning
off what we have since designated as X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. beach.
This is at Kaba Tepeh. The other detachments
of General Birdwood’s forces were
spread at anchorage up to and beyond Suvla
Bay. The particular stretch of territory that
we were called upon to capture was about 500
yards long. It was a nearly straight line of
coast. The beach was two hundred yards in
width with a gradual rising of sand dunes tufted
with dwarf holly bushes and miniature table
lands, which finally resolved itself into sheer
cliffs, some of them high and sharp like fangs,
others rounded, in all giving the impression of
the open, snarling jaw of some mammoth animal
with scraggy teeth.</p>

<p>Our battle ship pinnaces, that is to say,
barges, were launched and sent out to the different
transports to take aboard the landing parties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Each man as we stood at parade on the decks
before being ordered to the pinnaces had for
his supplies as indicated in General Birdwood’s
orders, his rifle and bayonet, 150 rounds of
ammunition and three days’ rations, which consisted
of his water bottle holding a quart of
water, furnished by the clear springs of Lemnos
Island, a tin of bully-beef to the weight of
half a pound, as many biscuits as he could take
on, while leaving room for his emergency tin
which holds tablets of concentrated beef and
cakes of chocolate. Besides in your pocket you
had your first-aid kit, a small roll of bandages
and a vial of iodine.</p>

<p>Weirdly began our great and deadly adventure
on this coveted stretch of the Ægean Sea
which if we could conquer made possible the
breaking of the historic barrier of the Dardanelles.
It was a stretch of coast we were soon
to wash with our blood as literally as the
Ægean’s waves wash the self-same shore.</p>

<p>The long procession of transports and their
grim battleship escorts had stolen up in the
night, a widely-spread yet organized, concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
group of slowly-moving, black, gloomy monsters.
Every light aboard each ship had been
ordered out. Not even the pin-head flame of
a cigarette might show on any deck.</p>

<p>The only light we had was the faint green
gleam that filtered over the smooth waters
from a moon that had begun to wane and had,
indeed, at this hour of three in the morning,
nearly fallen behind the ragged jaw of the black
cliffs.</p>

<p>I can tell you that we most heartily wished
this moon in &mdash;&mdash; well, anywhere than shining
just then upon this particular spot of the earth.
We little cared for a moon to direct a spotlight
on our surprise attack. It looked like an evil
moon to us. Or rather, it looked like the evil,
watchful eye of our enemy. For all of us
knew well enough what was behind those cliffs&mdash;about
two miles or thereabouts behind. Oh,
we knew well enough that there lay the Turks
and their big, German-managed guns.</p>

<p>The Turks couldn’t very well hear me talking
at from four to five miles, yet such was the consciousness
of the danger of our adventure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
such the hypnotism of the scene that when I
spoke to the comrade next to me, it was in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” I said, “what that old green eye
of a moon is looking at back of those dark, old
cliffs? I wonder if he sees the big guns drowsing
and the garrisons asleep or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What he’s seeing,” said the man at my side
in a grumble, “is the heathen blighters getting
ready to bang hell out of us!”</p>

<p>“Cheerful beggar you are,” I whispered back
the more gloomily because I was one of those
who had argued and felt certain that we were
not to take the Turks by surprise.</p>

<p>And now the men had assembled on the
decks as soft-footedly as they might. They had
gathered in the darkness into orderly rows like
big companies of phantoms. The ships’ crews
worked as spectrally and nearly as silently as
the lowering of ladders and the launching of
the boats would permit. Even the groaning and
wrenching of the chains and cables seemed
subdued and ghostly. Small steamboats each
with a swerving tail made up of barges and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
small boats panted alongside the transports and
battleships. With wonderful precision and
swiftness the great ships spawned hundreds on
hundreds of smaller craft, thousands on thousands
of men, crowding the waters with them
for as far as you could make out whichever way
you looked in the faint moonlight.</p>

<p>“Fall in Number Nine platoon!” came the
growled order.</p>

<p>That was my command.</p>

<p>I quickly had my men groping down the
companion ladder. There were sixty in my special
charge. By the time I had them all aboard
and had stepped into the barge myself where
we huddled with fully two hundred more, the
voice of our cocky little midshipman sounded.
He sat most correctly erect in the stern, his cap
at a jaunty angle, his slender neck in its broad
white collar. He was so very young and boyish
but he had an alert and business-like eye.</p>

<p>“Full up, sir,” he said smartly.</p>

<p>God bless and care for that gallant little
chap! I can’t help fervently wishing it as the
memory of him comes to me now. He was only
sixteen&mdash;the treble of childhood was still in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
voice. But in it as he gave his orders then and
afterward as well when frightful peril came,
were the steadiness and the coolness of a brave
man&mdash;the sort of man he must have become if
the dandy little youngster had not been destined
for death with those many, many others on this
April night.</p>

<p>The men in our barge as it bobbed about
began to pass jests, in whispers, of course.
Not that they felt giddy&mdash;funny. Or, yes,
in a way, a bit giddy&mdash;nervous tension, you
know. Like a small boy whistling in the dark.
And yet willing and eager to meet whatever
dragon might be there. For now we felt and
knew that all we had trained for, prepared for,
thought about, imagined&mdash;the big time of actual
warfare was at hand. That was what was most
alive in every man’s mind. But they joked.</p>

<p>“I’ve remembered you in my will, Jimmy,”
said one to a pal two rows behind him. “You’ll
get nothing short of a million, my son.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;‘cooties’?” demanded Jim. I think
I need not stop to describe “cooties,” those
“bosom friends” of the trenches.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste your millions on him, Bob,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
advised another. “Just leave’m a lock o’ your
’air.”</p>

<p>A small but very sharp voice cut in:</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>It was the middie, but for all save the pitch
of the voice it might have been a veteran commander.</p>

<p>“Cast off and drift astern,” directed a basso
from the transport’s deck.</p>

<p>Our little man expeditiously carried out the
order and slowly we drifted astern until there
came sudden twangs from the hawsers, startling
because everything had been so quiet or muffled
before. This was as the hawsers coupling
boats and barges went taut as each boat in succession,
filling with men, drew suddenly to a
halt its drifting predecessor.</p>

<p>Two of the men in our boat who were standing
were caught by the jerk of the hawser and
snapped overboard. They were fished out with
boathooks under the rapid, cool direction of the
indignant middie.</p>

<p>“Disgusting carelessness,” he called the incident.</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 209px;"><img src="images/i_fp_044.jpg" width="209" height="454" alt="" /><div class="caption">The Military Cross</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
When all the boats of our string had been
filled, there came the order to the tugs: “Full
steam ahead!”</p>

<p>Our tug was quite ready for it. Our string
straightened out in a jiffy and we got off to a
racing start&mdash;bounding, dipping and rolling.
Sometimes we shot ahead in a straight line,
sometimes in a half circle.</p>

<p>“God bless that damned old moon!” said a
man near me. His jumble of reverence and
profanity came from the fact that the old green
wicked eye of a moon had blinked out behind
the cliffs. A moment before I had looked back
and could see the battleship coming on slowly
in our rear with the obvious purpose of covering
our attack.</p>

<p>Then I couldn’t see a blessed thing. The
green waters had turned to ink. You only
knew your comrades were with you in the same
boat by the press of their swaying bodies
against your shoulders and your ribs.</p>

<p>About this time some of the gay Johnnies got
another severe reprimand from our kiddie commander.
They had undertaken to rise and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
holding their bayonets out over the waters like
fish poles, chaffing one another as to which of
them would catch the first Turk. All said they
wished it would be a particularly fat one&mdash;say,
a three hundred pounder.</p>

<p>But the middie’s eyes had got used to the
inky darkness and he spotted the jokers.</p>

<p>“No skylarking and silence all!” said the infant
“vet.” The men were pretty well on edge
by this time. And, as the world generally
knows, the Australian does not put much store
in military discipline. But these men obeyed the
little boy on the instant&mdash;all save one who
though as quick as the others in resuming his
proper place in the boat, disobeyed sufficiently
to remark in a whisper, good-natured and admiring:</p>

<p>“Who’d ’a’ thought we had admirals so
blarsted young!”</p>

<p>And by this time we were within two hundred
yards of the shore. A man near me voiced the
impression we all were getting.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” he said, “if we’re to
surprise them after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Then suddenly out of that weird darkness,
that curious silence that had been disturbed only
by the rapid, half-choked panting of the steam
tugs, the surge of the water against the sides of
the barges, the whispers, the occasional smothered
laughs&mdash;all soft sounds&mdash;there came hell&mdash;veritable
hell if ever hell comes to men on
earth! And it came with a tremendous roar!</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Ghastly Landing</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was a swift, sharp lightening of the
sky back of the gaunt, black cliffs and our boats
seemed thrown out of the water, thrown up into
the air by the rocking thunder of the heavy
guns of the Turkish batteries behind those cliffs.
The water that had been so smooth an instant
before, that was, in fact, so treacherously
smooth, as had been the silence, was stabbed
and chopped and sent into wild spume by a
great rain of shells. Blinding blasts flared as
suddenly as here and there a boat with its
living load was struck and shattered. Screams
and hoarse, impulsive cries began to mingle
with the explosions.</p>

<p>Then the cliffs and the sand dunes spat deadly
fire at us. In the darkness I could not, of
course, see it all. But it would seem from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
afterward I was able to learn that not one of
the pilots of the steam tugs thought of turning
back. I could not see it all and had no time to
think of much other than myself and my
platoon, a very few seconds after the bombardment
from the big guns of the forts began
dropping their big shells and the hail of the
machine guns sang among us.</p>

<p>Surprise?</p>

<p>They had our range as surely as if we stood
ten feet away from them. The water was cluttered
with the accurate assemblage of their
shots. Our battleships had begun an angry,
heavy retort but whether their great guns were
finding the marks, of course, we couldn’t know.
It would have been a mighty comfort to us then
to feel that these shots were smashing the
Turks.</p>

<p>There was no indication of it. Their fire became
more and more and more intense. Boat
after boat was being smashed. In not more
than three minutes after the enemy began his
bombardment against our landing, my own
boat went to smash. A shell struck it at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
bow. It shattered the boat and must have killed
at least a dozen men. I, fortunately, was in the
stern. With my comrades I was hurled into
the air and the next realization was that I was
far over my head in water and that the first
thing I must do if I was not to drown was to
get rid of my heavy knapsack.</p>

<p>Thank the Lord, I had been a sturdy swimmer
since childhood. I can’t begin to picture
to you how many scores of my comrades, unable
to swim or weak swimmers, died then and there&mdash;how
many of them with knapsacks on their
backs and guns and bayonets in their hands yet
remain at the bottom of the Ægean Sea, a curious
spectacle for the fish.</p>

<p>I fought my way to the surface. And I clung
to my gun and bayonet. I clung to them as
frantically as any drowning man is supposed to
clutch at a straw. For the only escape from
drowning was to get ashore and ashore I knew
there would be small hope for me without my
bayonet.</p>

<p>When I got to the surface other chaps were
struggling all around me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“Help each other get rid of these knapsacks,”
I yelled when I got my breath. “It’s our only
chance or we’ll drown like rats.”</p>

<p>So we struggled about aiding one another
free of these encumbrances. We had also to
let our ammunition belts go and held on only
to our guns. The shore was not far off now
and we swam for it. But as we drew near&mdash;very
near&mdash;within fifty feet or so, we encountered
a devilishly ingenious snare.</p>

<p>The enemy had constructed on stakes in eight
feet of water a barbed-wire entanglement along
more than two miles of the beach. I was overhanding
it for shore, supporting my rifle in the
other when I ran my face full tilt against the
barbed wire’s fangs. Others of my comrades
did the same. They cursed and moaned. We
hung on to the barbed wire but ducking every
instant for a scream of bullets was all around
us.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you how many of the landing
boats were smashed in the landing at Gallipoli.
None I believe knows with accuracy. How many
men were drowned outright none either can exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
tell. But there were hundreds. Nor how
many men, exhausted, striving for the shore,
were caught and held like netted fish in that
barbed-wire entanglement will never be known.
That scores&mdash;yes, hundreds were, I cannot
doubt. Some of the men immediately around
me I know were lost in the effort to get past it.</p>

<p>It was too closely netted to get through it.
Some possibly floated or were lifted over it by
the roll of the surf. I know only how I made
my own way out of the trap. And that was
by drawing myself down along the barbed
strands until I found a space some two feet
between the barbed-wire barrier and the sea-bottom.
And I crawled through!</p>

<p>A few strokes after that and I was able to
take to my feet and wade out. Well, hardly
that. I plunged, stumbled, fell and finally
crawled out on the bullet-spattered and shell-riven
sands.</p>

<p>I wasn’t paying the slightest attention to the
bullets or the shells. Honestly, I was too exhausted.
Had there been an enemy to meet me
as I flopped on the sands the worst I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
done to him by way of resistance would have
been to pat him on the cheek. If that much. I
just flopped and panted and panted. And as my
breath came slowly, very slowly back to normal
I was astonished to find that my rifle and bayonet
were still clutched in my hand.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the enemy’s own shells smashed
their cunning, barbed-wire, under-sea entanglement
and such sections of it as were not ripped
in that fashion were made harmless by plucky
bombing parties in battleship launches.</p>

<p>I didn’t lay very long gasping on the beach
for the music of the bullets made me realize
grimly enough that I wasn’t out surfing. I staggered
to my feet and began to take general
notice. The boats that survived had spilled
their men into the surf and the men, huddling
and scared, had nevertheless carried on. They
were fast crowding the strip of beach. Officers
were snapping out commands&mdash;heroically holding
their presence of mind and organizing their
men. Organizing, that is, what they could find
of them, or any men, for that matter, that they
could find around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
All these things had now become visible in
the dawn&mdash;the sudden dawn of the East. You
must understand that the bombardment was
ceaseless from the forts, the guns of all our
ships roaring back at them the while. But it
was the machine-gun fire and the rifle fire from
the Turks concealed among the sand dunes and
the clefts of the cliffs that were tearing our men
down. Sometimes the big shells smashed holes
in the beach and sent up great clouds of sands
that settled blindingly down upon us.</p>

<p>Our landing party was grotesque and wavering
under the frightful storm. Shouts, yells,
screams of pain, cries of alarm merged into a
great clamor. The most heartening thing, somehow,
in the darkness had become the Australian
cry of “Coo-ee!”&mdash;sharp and musical, in which
men had called themselves together into groups.
When the dawn came I was able to find twelve
of the sixty men of my command.</p>

<p>There was no living on the beach. The only
way out of that immediate hell was to charge
across the sands and get into the shelter of the
dunes, to fight our way to the base of the cliffs
and get away from the shells of the cliffs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
to fight our way into enemy trenches in the
table-lands and rout the snipers from their
lairs.</p>

<p>Don’t ask me how we did it. I am only prepared
to describe how myself and my dozen
men accomplished it. I wasn’t, you see, exactly
on a sight-seeing party.</p>

<p>In my little group of twelve who had been
tossed into the ocean and made their way
through the wave-submerged barbed wire we
didn’t have a thing to fight with but the cold
steel of our bayonets. Our ammunition belts
had perforce been abandoned with our knapsacks
and were at the bottom of the Ægean.</p>

<p>But His Majesty’s warships were giving us
a lot of aid. Their great guns were turned off
the distant Turkish forts for a while and their
lighter armament was also brought under full
play and together they swept the dunes and cliffs
above us with a merciless fire. Actually we saw
the bodies of our enemies, clusters of them,
spouting from the places of their concealment,
saw legs, arms and heads flying wildly in the
air.</p>

<p>But back of me along the mile and more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
beach there was a terrible litter of our own
dead. And every minute somewhere near me a
man was going down.</p>

<p>We got up those sand ridges any old way&mdash;by
digging in our bayonets like Alpine staffs,
clawing with our free hands, scrambling with
toe-holds and fighting up on all fours.</p>

<p>We had just gained a knoll of sand and bush
and taken protection behind it for a minute’s
breathing when one of my men, one of those
sturdy cattlemen who had made their way out
of the wilderness to get into the war for civilization,
went down with a bullet in his leg.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” he said, as I bent over him
to examine the wound, “and don’t stop for me.
Go on and come back for me later or maybe
the Red Cross lads will find me. A little thing
like this isn’t going to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was smiling as he talked, but suddenly his
head fell back, his smile widening into a horrible
grin. A bullet had taken him in the neck.
He was done for.</p>

<p>Of course, and luckily, there were only a few
of our thousands that had been blown out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
their boats and most of the lusty fighters of the
landing force had their ammunition in hand.
They were going after the Turks with rifle volleys
of deadly accuracy.</p>

<p>Having come alive through the terrible ordeal
of that shell and bullet strand of open beach,
the Australians and New Zealands were fired to
the highest fighting pitch. Companies of them
sang as they climbed and pushed and struggled
along&mdash;sang or rather yelled snatches of all
manner of songs though they didn’t sound much
like songs. More like strange, sustained savage
war cries.</p>

<p>There was no staying the impetuosity of some
of them.</p>

<p>When we had gained the upper ridges under
the very face of the cliffs and a furious mêlée
it was till we got there, orders flew from the
lips of the officers for the men to stop and “dig
in.” The ragged sandstone cliffs were pierced
by hundreds of tortuous pathways and there
was no telling what traps might lie in these
crevices and mazes. The enemy had already
given evidence that in tunnels in the cliffs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
located batteries from which had come the
most withering of fires until the warships’
guns got after them. But beyond the face of
the cliffs it was foolhardy for any officer to
lead his men against an enemy save one in
full retreat. And although it was evident by
this time that we had the Turks on the run,
it was equally evident to our officers that
their commanders had been so confident in
the frightfulness of the fire upon the landing
parties and the impediments of barbed wire
they had planted in the ocean, that they had not
massed a strong force in the sand dunes on
the face of the hills. The probability of a
much stronger force back of the cliffs practically
amounted to a certainty.</p>

<p>And although we had the Turks on the run,
their forts two and three miles away were still
pouring their fire without an instant’s let-up on
the beach and for half a mile or more into
the water.</p>

<p>But, in spite of orders, hundreds of our
warriors refused to stop. They charged right
on through the pathways and tunnels in the
cliffs. We never saw them again. Those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
were not killed were captured by the Turks. We
used to say in speaking of them afterward that
they had “gone on to Constantinople.”</p>

<p>My little band, now numbering eleven, I
brought together on a shelf near the face of the
cliffs and we tried to dig in. But we had only
our bayonets for implements and the ground
was a hard, brittle admixture of sand and stone.
So, instead, I ordered them to gather a sufficient
number of the chunks of rock that had
been shattered from the face of the cliffs by the
battleship’s big guns and we constructed a
horseshoe shaped retreat&mdash;one that would protect
us against an enfilade. In this we esconced
ourselves and looked from time to time on the
bombardment, going as furiously as ever between
the warships and the distant forts with
an occasional vicious spurting exchange between
our light land batteries which we had got ashore
in the face of everything, and the hidden
batteries that still held on among the cliffs.
But mostly we snuggled with heads well down
below the walls of our little forts for the bullets
of snipers were pinging all around us. And you
can imagine they had made things damned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
merry for us while we were doing our bit of
architecture. The Turks at the time must have
been pretty well demoralized for let me tell you
that, in ordinary circumstances, the Turk is altogether
too accurate a shot. As it was,
there was only one member of my little crowd
who got hurt&mdash;a Melbourne boy who had two
fingers ripped off his left hand as he was shoving
a big, ragged chunk of sandstone in place
on the fortress wall.</p>

<p>Just as we had settled down to hold out until
nightfall should take from us the uncomfortable
job of being targets for snipers, I was startled
by a big, horny-handed man in my company, a
fellow with a cave-man’s face and wicked eye.
He had suddenly started blubbering. Before
any of us could stop him, he jumped to his feet,
showed himself head and shoulders above our
baby fortress’ walls, and shook his fist fiercely
in the general direction of the Turks. Their
snipers answered him with a furious spitfire of
bullets. We dragged him down and I demanded:</p>

<p>“What the devil’s got into you, anyhow?
Want to get us all killed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
“The little admiral!” he roared back at me
in fury. “I was thinking it was those dogs and
their guns killed that kid&mdash;I tried to get to him
when the barge blew up. Plucky little devil!
He was hanging on to the stern and yelling
orders to us to be ‘Steady’ and ‘Hold on.’ And
then another shell hit the damn’ thing and he
was gone.” He tried to get up again, but we
held him down. “The damn’ kid-killing bunch
of dogs!” he yelled.</p>

<p>But there were other hearts, yes, thousands
and thousands of hearts as staunch as the “little
admiral’s” in that red day of horror. There
was the work done by the Australian Army
Service Corps&mdash;landing a steady procession of
boats loaded with medical and food supplies as
well as ammunition, fleets on fleets of these boats
from the transports and battleships moving to
shore with the coolest regularity with the waters
around every one of them constantly thrashed
by tons of falling shells. Scores of the boats
were blown up. But the others never stopped
only where there was a chance of rescue of
the men flung from the shattered boats.</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers and the doctors we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
could also see working calmly among the sand
dunes, ignoring snipers’ bullets as though they
had been harmless flakes of snow. Slow and
painful files of the wounded&mdash;those who could
walk or stagger along were being guided to protected
places until the coming of night might enable
their removal to the hospital ships.</p>

<p>As for the dead whose countless prone bodies
strewn upon the beach with curious pitiful
inertness so different from that of sleep, that
you know instinctively means death&mdash;there was
no use then risking live men to give the dead
the attention, to award them such decencies of
care and burial as were their due. This also
would be the work of the night. Yes, and with
many a man as he worked over the graves of
his fallen comrades pitching into that grave,
himself become a dead man&mdash;betrayed to a
sniper by the moonlight’s gleam.</p>

<p>Twilight veiled the sun and then very suddenly
black night came.</p>

<p>Well, we had done the thing, done what
many men of authority had thought it would
be impossible for us to do, what Lord Kitchener
was afterward to describe as one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
brilliant feats of bravery and soldiering of the
war. We had effected a landing at Gallipoli.
Perilously we were to hold our place on this
narrow little peninsula, this back door of the
Dardenelles, for months to come.</p>

<p>But at what a price! And through what suffering
and horror!</p>

<p>Out of the 20,000 men who landed at Gallipoli
by my own observation and all report, I
do not think that 1,000 are alive today!</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Holding On</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Our little fortress or “sangar” could be
likened to a cauldron for it was constantly
surrounded by fire&mdash;the bursting, flaming shells,
and the pepper of snipers’ bullets like the sharp
bubbling of boiling water to “carry on” the
likeness of a cauldron. Down on the beach at
the first ridge of rocky embankment the engineers
had most bravely under a frightful fire
blasted great dug-outs for the establishment of
headquarters, a hospital, and the first station
for the storing of supplies.</p>

<p>There never was an instant’s cessation of the
storm of Turkish shells from the batteries back
of the cliffs, but other little companies like my
own had gained a foot-hold on the first ridge
and held on desperately.</p>

<p>Something like organization was coming
out of the chaos. My men were showing no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
signs of panic. I dispatched two messengers
back to the beach to report my position, the
number of men still with me, and to secure
food and ammunition. These men in common
with other messengers sent from similar
small strongholds on the ridge, had a most
dangerous duty to perform. They ran the
gamut of intense fire. Many of them were
killed. But my men successfully returned. They
came laden with bully beef, biscuits and jam.
Our emergency rations had disappeared hours
before and we were brisk enough in opening the
boxes and tins and strengthening ourselves with
bully beef, biscuits and jam.</p>

<p>The organization at headquarters went on
with remarkable efficiency considering the
stormy environment. I soon received a reinforcement
which brought my reduced company
of twelve men up to my original quota of sixty.</p>

<p>In the protection of night relays of messengers
worked briskly in bringing to us rifles and
ammunition to complete our supplies. Not that
these messengers had any easy pathway. The
storm of shrapnel was ceaseless and it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
bright night. We were as grateful for the ammunition
as for the food because, as I have
already told, all the men of my detachment had
been blown into the water and in the saving
of their own lives had necessarily abandoned
their cartridge belts.</p>

<p>The Turks were still firmly holding a ridge
some eighty feet above us from which throughout
the night they kept up a playful attack of
machine guns, and their snipers were tireless.
My men were so annoyed at these attentions
that I had some difficulty in restraining them
from making sorties. One of the men recklessly
stuck his head above the rocky wall of the “sangar”
and queried:</p>

<p>“Where are the Turks?”</p>

<p>“Over there,” I said, with a nod toward the
ridge.</p>

<p>“Don’t they ever show themselves?” he demanded
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Put your head down, get down, you chump,
or you’ll never live to see one of them,” I told
him.</p>

<p>Another time a sniper’s bullet ricochetted
around the rocky wall of the “sangar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“What’s that?” demanded one of my men.</p>

<p>“A ricochet,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Don’t we use them, too?” asked this guileless
rookie.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us the Turks on the ridge
above were not possessed of bombs. They tried
to make up for this deficiency by hurling at us
huge chunks of rock that had been smashed
by our battle-ship attack from the face of their
sandstone cliffs.</p>

<p>We made them a better retort. We took
our bully beef tins and jam tins and tobacco
tins, loaded them with broken stones and cordite
taken from our rifle cartridges, and messengers
were dispatched to return with other
forms of explosives and fuses to aid us in the
completion of these amateur weapons of war.
We lighted them from our cigarette ends and
hurled them in whatever direction a Turk had
betrayed his presence. Sometimes they would
explode prematurely and not a few of the
bombers of that night had their faces blown
away.</p>

<p>Dawn found us still in possession of the first
ridge. While we remained there inactive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
before any order had been given to indicate
that we were to assault the upper ridge, there
came an order which aroused my wonder and
opposition. It was to “Fix bayonets!”</p>

<p>Obedience to this order all along our position
brought about a startling betrayal of the whereabouts
of the entire force, for the sunshine
glittered brilliantly on the steel blades and
fairly telegraphed the location of all our quotas
to the enemy above.</p>

<p>I knew there must be some mistake and
cried to my men, “Unfix bayonets! Who the
hell gave that order?”</p>

<p>I never found out, but I have very definite
suspicion. I am certain it was a false order circulated
by spies, which we were subsequently to
discover were among us.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the German spy system
even invaded the very personnel of the British
army. My platoon sergeant, Merrifield, summarily
accounted for one of these spies. This
was some weeks later, at the attack at
Lone Pine. We had won the position and
we were consolidating, improving upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
trenches and the strongholds which we had
captured when the order come down from the
left, “Retire! to the first line.”</p>

<p>I shouted “Stick where you are! Who gave
that damned order?”</p>

<p>I sent up Merrifield to make inquiries and
as he was making his way along the line asking
the men where the order had come from,
it was pointed out to him that a man on the left
started the order. Merrifield went up to him
and asked who gave that order to retire. This
man replied “Lieutenant Wilhelm.” We had
seen enough of spy work since we left Australia
and Merrifield, rushing up, faced Wilhelm. He
did not stop to question him. He read in the
man’s countenance the appearance of a Teuton,
the broad face, high cheek-bones and broad
neck. And Merrifield took long chances but
was too enraged to consider that. “You damned
square-head,” he shouted, and with the utterance
of the words killed the lieutenant with his
bayonet. Wilhelm’s attempted treachery not
only cost him his life, but did not gain its end,
for the order never got any farther. On examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
his person, we found letters, photographs
and a signal code, all going to show that however
recklessly he had acted, Merrifield had
made no mistake.</p>

<p>The night of the second day found us in positions
higher up among the sandy table lands and
ridges and dug into positions that we were to
hold for a few weeks waiting for reinforcements,
which were coming up from Egypt.</p>

<p>The Turkish snipers occupied a great deal of
our attention all this time and they were a cunning
lot. They were adepts in the art of camouflage&mdash;an
art which was new to battlefields at
this time. Their favorite method of deception
was to paint their bodies green, to shroud their
heads with the natural foliage of the country,
moss and holly-bush twigs. With this arrangement
they could conceal themselves as neatly
and completely as snakes in the grass. They
not only hid in the shrubbery, but successfully
concealed themselves in the stunted trees that
grew among the rocky crevices. The cliffs
themselves gave them a tremendous advantage.
In this they had drilled shooting boxes&mdash;holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
in all manner of secret recesses large enough to
hold their bodies.</p>

<p>But we did not permit them to pot us
wholly undisturbed. Many of our men made
night expeditions that silenced forever our hidden
hunters. One of my bush men came back
from such an expedition with a startling souvenir.
It was nothing less than a head of one
of the Turkish snipers&mdash;the face of the ghastly
object painted green, twigs enmeshed in the hair
and sticking out of the ears.</p>

<p>But after a while we were to meet the Turk
and find him not such a bad fellow. I asked
the prisoners we captured why they were
fighting. They said, they didn’t know what they
were fighting for, but they just wanted to have
a fight. A rejoinder which an Irishman like
myself could appreciate. In a conversation
with an educated Turk I asked him why they
allowed the Germans to be the master. He replied
that the Germans had for the last forty
years over-run his country and taken over the
direction of the civil, the military and the naval
affairs of his nation, and they were so strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
dealt with the Turks with such an iron hand,
that there was no commencing a mutiny. It
had been tried and proved a fiasco.</p>

<p>During the months of July and August when
the sun was very hot and the ground very dry,
and the flies and the mosquitoes were everywhere,
water became scarce, for it was a waterless
land we were on. The Turkish prisoners,
so friendly did they become with us, went back
to their own lines and brought us water. We
sent others back to try and persuade their kind
to come over and give themselves up. We fed
them well, gave them the best that we had, and
made jolly good fellows of them, as they were
indeed. They had given us a good fight and
we appreciate a good fighter. Though they
went back to their own lines they would always
return and brought us frequently gourds of
fresh water. The water that we got ourselves
was coming from Murdos and Lemnos Islands.
It was brackish and it stunk. We were only
allowed one pint per man a day, a stingy ration
under a tropic sun. The Turks said they brought
us water because when wounded Turks lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
gasping for water, we had given them of our
own.</p>

<p>Then the time came when we were getting
an extra supply of jam, and there were only two
kinds of jam issued&mdash;plum and an apple and
apricot combination. Of course, that set us all
grumbling, soldier-like, because we didn’t get
strawberry. One day one of the men hit upon
the idea of exchanging this jam with wine with
which the French soldiers over Suvla Bay way
were liberally supplied. This exchange went on
for about a fortnight, and there were happy
times in the trenches. Then the French got fed
up with this sameness of jam and our stocks
dropped below zero. So we had to look out for
another customer. One of our boys hit upon
the idea of exchanging the jam with the Turks.
During the day we put up our articles of exchange&mdash;jam
and bully beef on bayonets and
held them up in prominent positions on the front
line trenches. And we waited anxiously as to
what was going to happen, and lo! at night we
heard and saw the Turks crawling through the
brushwood and scrub, growling and muttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to themselves as their whiskers were caught on
the twigs of the bushes. When they reached
the front-line trenches they took off the articles
of exchange and put in their place wines, cigarettes
and Turkish “delight,” as we always
called the tobacco. That showed us that they
didn’t want war and we knew we didn’t want
war, but the Germans wanted it and as long
as they wanted it we had to keep going.</p>

<p>Likewise we had other experiences that were
not all grim, but they were exciting. For instance,
our bathing parties on the beach. We
didn’t have to bother with bathing suits or summer-resort
regulations, but we had the novelty
of bathing to the accompaniment of shell fire.
When we saw shells diving we dived to get out
of the way.</p>

<p>Gallipoli at this period of the year was a frying
pan. Men found their uniforms intolerable.
We cut our trousers into “knickers,”
abandoned our tunics, and did all our fighting
in bare knees and shirt sleeves. Our enemies
got a wrong impression from this. Turkish
prisoners told us that the report among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
was we were falling so short of supplies that
we were cutting our trousers in two to make
double the number of pairs. The idea of our
poverty of supplies was further strengthened
by the fact that many of our men abandoned
shirts entirely and moved about like savages
with bronzed bodies naked of all covering save
the knickers and their socks and boots. Our
aspect and the fact that our men went after
them practically always with a bayonet, won
for us from the Turk the respectful sobriquet
of the “White Ghurkas,” the Ghurkas being
famous for their fondness and expertness in the
use of the knife.</p>

<p>Not to give the reader too happy an impression
of affairs as they stood with us in Gallipoli
after the night of our desperate landing, it
might be well to note here that of our original
landing force of 20,000 there had been at least
5,000 casualties among us. The night of the
landing in the storm from the Turkish forts,
the cliff batteries, the machine guns and the
snipers, and also the drownings, fully 3,000
men had been killed or wounded. In the intermittent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
fighting of the following weeks preceding
the attacks on Lone Pine and Chocolate
Hill, the work of the sharp-shooters, added to
that of many small engagements, had further
depleted our numbers 2,000 more at least. We
had held our own under these harrowing circumstances
from the last of April until August
when the second division of 20,000 new Anzacs
came to join us.</p>

<p>In the fleet of transports that bore the fresh
contingent of Australians and New Zealanders,
was the <i>Southland</i>, she who was torpedoed in
the Mediterranean. The men who arrived told
us a most interesting story of the experience of
the <i>Southland</i> and the 1,300 troops aboard her.
It will be recalled that after being torpedoed
the <i>Southland</i> had a remarkably long life.
She was kept afloat for hours until beached
on a rocky strand. The descriptions we got
of the behavior of the Anzacs and her crew
were thrilling in the courage, cheerfulness and
display of humor on the part of hundreds of
Britishers, who had no way of knowing at what
moment the wounded ship might plunge to the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
One of the things they did was to hold
an impromptu auction sale of the crippled
<i>Southland</i>. Bids for the great boat, whose
cost had been a half million, started at a
shilling and while she was being battered on
the sand and rocks, rose to the majestic sum of
one pound. She was knocked down at that
price to an Anzac, who later, in all hopefulness,
was to file his claim of ownership with the marine
registry at London. He announced his intention
after the war of taking the <i>Southland</i>
back home with him to make of it an Australian
bungalow.</p>

<p>The <i>Southland</i> they told us landed with
her nose high in the air, and there was
rivalry as to who should be the last to leave the
ship. Men scrambled up the steeply slanting
deck, clinging to rails, cabin doors, and any
other object offering hand- or foot-hold. There
were big bathing parties around the wreck, before
the men were picked up by the launches
and barges from the other transports and battle
ships. In the first of the shock from the
torpedo and when all were in expectancy of the
<i>Southland’s</i> going down, the men assembled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the decks and bravely set up the Australian
song composed by a British naval officer, which
had become dear to them:</p>

<p>In looking over the notes and papers I have
collected to aid me in the preparation of this
book, memory is vigorously stirred by a clipping
of an article from the Sydney <i>Mail</i> of
October 31, 1917, written by a fellow officer
who prefers to remain anonymous. He wrote
well of the familiar scenes of the famous battlefield
as they would appear today. Following
is an extract:</p>

<p>“The ‘Vineyard’ has blossomed and the small
green grapes cluster on the vine. The well by
the fisherman’s hut has run sweet once more.
The cave dwellers by Shrapnel Gully, Quinn’s
Post and Courtenay’s are as quiet and still as
tombs. Grass and weeds have grown over the
winding paths that thread the valleys and
scrape the hilltops. The sandbags of the traverses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
have rotted and burst, spilling their earth
on the litter of these battles of yesterday. And
out through the chessboard field the grave-mounds
of earth that we pattered down with
spade and entrenching tool have blossomed
with wild flowers and green grass. The warm,
tideless Ægean washes these empty beaches
where once thousands of men from the Empire’s
back-blocks made war as it had never been
made before.</p>

<p>“Two years ago forty thousand men walked
these paths. They slept in these dug-outs, or
in the trenches, and the detonation of the guns
of the warships shook loose the earth and sand
above them so that it rattled down in their
faces, waking them from dreams of home to an
uncomfortable reality. Think of those three
days two years ago! Think of the waterless
fight for Chocolate Hill; of the wounded lying
in the brushwood and waiting for the sweeping
grass fires to reach their resting place. Men
lay there unable to move; some of them not
able to pull their water bottles from their web-slings!
Think of them and remember them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
for in all wars there was never a more gallant
forlorn hope than this one.</p>

<p>“Lone Pine, Chocolate Hill, Sari Bair and
Biyuk Anafarta were goals set far ahead. Many
reached them and never came back. Lone Pine
was attacked on August 6 and of all the attacks
at Gallipoli, this was, perhaps, the most terrible.
The Turkish trenches were supplied with
head covers made of stout timber. Under these
were loopholes from which the Turks fired with
temporary immunity at the advance Australian
battalions. The enfilade fire was terrible, but
the men bodily lifted the timber beams and
dropped feet first into the dark trenches beneath.
By 5:47 <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, 17 minutes after the first
advance, we held the trenches. At 1:30 the
same night there came a terrific counter-attack
headed by scores of bombers. For seven hours
the counter-attack pressed, wave on wave of
Turks coming from the very parapet often to
be shot and fall into the trench. One Australian
brigade, only two thousand strong, carried
this work in the face of an entire enemy division
and held it during six days’ counter-attacks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
A thousand corpses were in the trench system
after the occupation and to make room for the
fighting men these were stacked in piles at intervals
between the traverses.</p>

<p>“There was one example there that will never
die. The 7th Gloucester lost all their officers
and senior non-commissioned officers, but they
fought on, mere isolated groups of men and
the privates and lance-corporal, green troops
of the New Army from midday until sunset!
The Lancashires, the Hampshires, Gloucesters,
Australians and New Zealanders&mdash;all did men’s
work in those days. None of their deeds will
die, none of the names of men or regiment will
ever be forgotten.”</p>

<p>I was in the attack of Lone Pine which carried
our armies nearest to the goal of capturing
the coveted strip between the Ægean and
the Straits of Dardanelles. I got my first
wound of the war in the winning of these timber-roofed
trenches, a bayonet thrust in the
darkness ripping my right hand open but doing
my hand in the matter of its future usefulness
no permanent injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Reinforcements had come to us till our numbers
stood at forty thousand, but with the reinforcements
also came aëroplanes which later
“spotted” for us the information that the Turks
on the tops of the ridges outnumbered us by
many thousands. They had also the support
of the great guns of their forts although our
battle ships had made the contests in artillery
fairly even duels.</p>

<p>Lone Pine Hill was the most prominent ridge
on our front. It was so named because the
sweep of our fire had leveled a small forest so
completely that only a single pine tree remained.
Its foliage had been entirely blown away. There
was left of it but its broken trunk and two
gaunt limbs, blackened by explosions and
upraised, curiously resembling the arms of a
soldier in the act of surrender. We took this
to be a good omen when on the afternoon of
August 6th our orders came that on this night
we were to mount these 500 yards of rock,
stubble and moss and possess ourselves of this
highest point of the enemy positions.</p>

<p>We felt all confident. With reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of our own Anzacs had come moreover big supplies
of ammunition, machine guns and additional
artillery.</p>

<p>But also we knew the way ahead to be a hard
one to travel and our aëroplane observers in
their reports and photographs had shown how
deeply and firmly the Turks under their German
officers had fixed themselves in the trenches on
the summit of Lone Pine.</p>

<p>Nearly all the attacks up to this time had
begun in the dawn. This time the attack was
ordered immediately on the fall of darkness.
The strategy succeeded. There is no doubt that
a night advance was a big surprise for we had
made our way up along two hundred yards of
ground before they suspected our coming. Then
they flashed their star-shells in the sky and swept
us with a howling fire. It stopped us for a time,
but we pulled ourselves together and held on
until our commanders were certain that the
Zion Mule Corps under Colonel Paterson, the
famous Jewish contingent in this action at Gallipoli,
were behind us with their sturdy animals
heavily laden with the bombs that we already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
knew to be so vital a weapon in trench-storming.
They used the mules as well to bring us
additional machine guns. But most of all we
needed a chance to catch our breath. Our halt
did not in the least mean our doubt of ability
to get those trenches. It was part of good wisdom
that our men should not attain the top of
the ridge winded and exhausted from the climb.</p>

<p>We halted crouching behind the rocks and
knolls, gasping at first, for only about five minutes.
Then we started to cover the rest of the
climb and give the Turks and their German
commanders “what for.”</p>

<p>The Turkish trenches, it must be understood,
were built in the hillside and their timber-roofs
slanted toward us. These roofs were honeycombed
with loop-holes from which their fire
snarled at us as we came. Its first effect was
deadly, but there was no wavering. Against the
geysers of bullets these covered trenches were
throwing up we simply went to work with our
trench knives and bayonets, used them as crowbars
and ripped the timbers loose. We blew
the timbers into the air as well with bombs although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
many of our men were disabled, being
wounded by big flying splinters in the process.
We dropped right in on top of the Turks and
fought them hand to hand in their own dug-outs.
It was fast fighting and we swiftly overwhelmed
them. I recall to the reader as accurate
the statement of the writer in the Sydney
<i>Mail</i> that we captured Lone Pine Ridge in
seventeen minutes of direct attack.</p>

<p>The Turks fell completely away from Lone
Pine Ridge and retreated fully a mile across a
shallow valley and on to another ridge where
we knew from our aëroplane scouts they had
another strong position. In the judgment of
our commanders we must be content to hold the
elevation, the next advance, if it were to be
undertaken, would have to be with the aid of
tremendous artillery force in the taking of the
great Dardenelles forts themselves.</p>

<p>From 6 o’clock in the evening of August 6th
until half-past one the following morning you
might have supposed that the Turkish soldier
was a phantom for all we ever saw of him.
But the batteries of the big forts never let up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
For six weeks they were to hold us under a fire
night and day. It wasn’t exactly continuous, but
you never could tell when it would open up and
never a day or night passed that did not find us
under attack.</p>

<p>At half-past one o’clock in the morning of
August 7th the Turks came back, seeking to regain
the Lone Pine position. They fought us
fiercely. They stormed their way against terrific
machine-gun fire to the very brink of our
trenches. Sometimes they got into the very
trenches themselves and our men found them
hard fighters in hand to hand struggles and, not
like the Germans as we were to discover later,
cowards under the rip and stab of cold steel.</p>

<p>They were tireless in attack. We sent back
waves of them, but other waves came on. They,
too, had their battle songs, or I should say song.
It was always the same tune they sang in swooping
at us, a curious whining refrain that would
suddenly end in a high note of ferocity or anticipated
triumph.</p>

<p>There was a man at the end of the trench
that we had taken who did not belong to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
battalion, but who had jumped into the trench
suddenly with a whole box of bombs in his
arms and who before he got finished with that
night’s work had won the Victoria Cross. I
saw him in the thick of a fight passing out bombs
with splendid strength and swiftness. Besides
as I kept watching him he was tireless. He
stopped rush after rush of battle-mad Turks as
they tried to force their way into our dug-outs.
Noting his effectiveness, I gave orders to keep
him well supplied with bombs. I ordered two
men behind him for relief, but he kept constantly
shouting back that he was feeling fine
and able to carry on. In the morning that particular
fight was over and around the section of
the trench where this man fought we counted
forty-seven Turkish dead. He wasn’t scratched.
My memory is playing me badly at the
moment and I can’t give his name. He was,
however, sufficiently recognized in the official
dispatches which in naming him identified him
as a famous cricket player of Australia. His
bowling arm had certainly done noble work
that night. Without the tireless stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
bombs we kept in the air at the enemy I am not
sure that we could have held on to our particular
section of the trench.</p>

<p>Official dispatches have told how we hung
on to these advanced trenches from August
until October, how the Turk was kept in
subjection in so far as the territory we had
so vigorously acquired. We settled down in the
sandstone hills and grimly endured through
these months an intolerably monotonous life.</p>

<p>We almost welcomed the blizzard that struck
us in the latter part of October because of the
change it gave us, that is to say, we welcomed
it the first day when the snow covered the
ridges and thousands of British soldiers turned
into rollicking boys. We snowballed each other,
we mixed our jam with the clean white snow,
called it sherbet and gobbled it, improvised skis
out of the bottoms of barrels and shot over the
ridges like human darts, built snow Germans
and snow Turks and knocked them over and
one company created the greatest attraction by
building a big snow Kaiser which we bayoneted
to pieces with great shouts of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
But we had to pay for this fun in the succeeding
weeks in which the trenches remained
frozen and the air bit into us cruelly. It was
a big change from the blazing heat of the summer
climate on the peninsula to the arctic
weather that swept so suddenly down. And
many new crosses were erected in the hillside
cemeteries over the graves of men who died of
pneumonia. Thousands were tortured by pneumonia
and the minor infliction of frost-bite.</p>

<p>Long ago water had become too precious a
thing to be used for shaving and our men
had become as whiskery as the Turks. One
fellow one morning looking through his trench
periscope caught a reflection of himself in its
mirror. He had grown a foot and one-half of
black whiskers, but hadn’t realized the change it
would make in his appearance. So he let a yell
out of him to give us the alarm that the Turks
were at our trench. But his own magnificent
growth of black whiskers had deceived him.</p>

<p>We lived so long in these trenches that
were so much like rabbit warrens that we had
got to calling ourselves rabbits and one disconsolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
man of mine that I found sitting in the
trench one day and asked of him what might
be the cause of his deep dejection answered:</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my ears to get longer and
my tail to sprout.”</p>

<p>I come now to a day in November, to be
exact the 25th. This was to be a historic event
for us Anzacs and will doubtless rank as a historic
event of the war. It was the visit of Lord
Kitchener to Anzac as we now call the two miles
of Gallipoli strip we held. I am not in a position
to make the statement authoritatively, but
I think his coming was a complete surprise to
the commandants. It certainly was to the rank
and file. He arrived on a man-o’-warsman.
Of course, great honors were paid him. The
Turks were no longer active and the commanders
had no hesitation in assembling fully
ten thousand men on the beach to stand in
review before the great leader. I was fortunately
among them. I had, when in service in
India (1906&ndash;1911), been a participant in the
famous Kitchener maneuvers.</p>

<p>I naturally looked at him searchingly to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
what changes might have been wrought by the
war and its responsibilities. He did look older
as he stood before us&mdash;much older. He was a
little stooped, but in the stride of his long lean
figure he was as vigorous as I had ever seen
him. And his eyes were keen and full of light
and strength as he stood before us. It wasn’t
until days later that positive orders came when
we learned officially that Gallipoli was to be
evacuated. But he practically told us that fact
that day. For a brief talk to the army followed
his visit and inspection of three hours of the
front trenches, his own observations with
glasses from certain places of vantage, a submission
to his consideration of all the aëro-photographs
that had been taken of the Turkish
positions and strength and a long conference
with the supreme commandant of the period,
Sir Charles Monro.</p>

<p>I will try to repeat Lord Kitchener’s words
to us as literally, as accurately as memory will
serve. He said:</p>

<p>“The King and your country appreciate most
deeply the great work you have done. To have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
effected a landing on this hostile shore and to
have held it as splendidly as you have done is
in itself a great triumph for British arms. I
regret that the necessities of our armies, in conformation
to other plans drawn, may not permit
you to remain to complete this noble success.”</p>

<p>And so Kitchener left us. His visit was not
longer than twenty-four hours&mdash;in fact, the
man-o’-warsman that brought him into Anzac
Cove slipped away in the darkness, sometime
before dawn.</p>

<p>But from that day we knew that all the perils
and hardships we had endured in the fight for
Gallipoli were to be crossed out in the record
of results of the war. There began from
November 26th a silent, secretive movement to
effect our evacuation.</p>

<p>It must go down in history that this was most
subtly done. If the Turks had ever suspected
that we were thinking of withdrawing, they
might have in the last two weeks of the evacuation,
at least, swooped down and slaughtered
the third of the force which was actually left
on the Gallipoli strip. We used countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
schemes of deception. To be specific we would
send away boat loads of a thousand men in the
night, but in the daylight land boat loads of
a hundred to fool the Turkish observers into
believing we were landing new forces. In the
same way we would transport thousands of
boxes of bombs and cartridges out of the trenches
and the harbor in the night to the battle ships
and in the daylight land from our barges,
steamboats, pinnaces and launches, thousands
and thousands of empty boxes that had contained
the ammunition.</p>

<p>As we also withdrew our effects from the
front-line trenches, our engineers displayed the
greatest activity in making of all these trenches
and barbed-wire entanglements the most ingenious
of mechanical man-traps. Any force of
Turks which attempted to swoop down the
ridges against our slowly departing brigades
would confront explosions of mines wonderfully
camouflaged along the goat paths that
were the only roads to have passed through
the barbed-wire barriers and in and over deserted
trenches would have set ablaze other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
deadly outbursts of explosions. We also
had set cunningly placed rifles on our outposts
which would have been set off by any
prowling Turkish scout, kill him in all
probability and at the same time give us
an alarm.</p>

<p>We were not without our expressions of sentiment
in abandoning Gallipoli for which we
had fought so hard. We went among the rocks
and heather and gathered wattle, otherwise
known as memosa which is a sort of holly
whose berries are yellow. It is the winter flower
of the Gallipoli peninsula. We fashioned
these into thousands of wreaths and in the very
last days of our departure placed them on the
graves of our dead.</p>

<p>And frankly we had no great resentment
against the Turk. He had been a hard fighter
but always a fair one. He had always battled
as man against man. Somehow, his German
officers had never been able to make him, if
they tried, the barbarous, underhand, contemptible
fighter into which I was soon to learn they
could develop their own German soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
As a matter of fact, we left friendly signs
behind. One placard read: “Au revoir&mdash;Brother
Turk. Hope to see you again.” Another
placard read: “To long Whiskers.”</p>

<p>One dug-out showed a placard announcing:
“Anzac Villa&mdash;To Let for the Season. Beautiful
Sandy Beach all to Yourself. Splendid sea
view. Home comforts. Lots of pleasure and
excitement.”</p>

<p>Since Gallipoli German propagandists, with
an idea of humiliating England in the world’s
opinion, have spread reports that if the British
forces had held out a month longer we would
have triumphed on the peninsula&mdash;that the
Turks were on the verge of surrender.</p>

<p>Such reports are childish in their palpable
falsity. As a matter of fact we were less than
40,000 men against 500,000. Against the great
guns of the Turkish fort we had only in like
artillery the great guns of our battle ships. And
the battle ships were being menaced by submarines.
It is only for me to set down that
the great Kitchener going thoroughly over the
situation forced the evacuation that was so
masterfully managed.</p>

<p>“Official documents”&mdash;the words convey
the impression of dry reading&mdash;but I do not

and its evacuation.</p>

<p>There is Lord Kitchener’s message to the
Anzacs and in addition to its nobility and eloquence
and the dignified State diction in which
it was couched, there is the little addition of
Gen. Birdwood, informal and affectionate,
which touched us as deeply, made us feel as
proud as did the message of his Majesty and
Lord Kitchener.</p>

<p>This message, which came to us after Lord
Kitchener had addressed us and strongly conveyed
without positively stating the Empire’s
decision of a withdrawal from Gallipoli, was as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center large">LORD KITCHENER’S MESSAGE.</p>

<p class="center larger"><span class="smcap">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</span></p>

<p class="center larger">Special Army Corps Order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 25, 1915. Lord Kitchener has
desired me to convey to the Australian and New
Zealand Army Corps, a message with which
he was specially entrusted by the King to bring
to our Army Corps.</p>

<p>His Majesty commanded Lord Kitchener to
express his high appreciation of the gallant and
unflinching conduct of our men through fighting
which has been harder than any yet seen during
the war, and his Majesty wishes to express
his complete confidence in the determination
and fighting qualities of our men to assist in
carrying this war to an entirely successful
termination.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener has ordered me to express
to all the very great pleasure it gave him to
have the opportunity which he considers a privilege,
of visiting “Anzac” to see for himself some
of the wonderfully good work which has been
done by the officers and men of our Army Corps,
as it was not until he had himself seen the
positions we had captured and held, that he was
able to fully realize the magnitude of the work
which has been accomplished. Lord Kitchener
much regretted that time did not permit of his
seeing the whole corps, but he was very pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to see a considerable proportion of officers and
men, and so confidently imbued that the grand
spirit, which has carried them through all their
trials and many dangerous feats of arms, a
spirit which he is quite confident they will maintain
to the end, until they have taken their full
share in completely overthrowing our enemies.</p>

<p>Boys! We may all well be proud to receive
such a message and it is up to all of us to live
up to them and prove their truth.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">W. R. Birdwood.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Gen. A. Lynden Bell, Chief of the
General Staff of the Mediterranean Expeditionary
force, issued the order for the Evacuation of
“Anzac.” It was such as to take the sting out
of it for us who had fought so hard, but must
relinquish what we had won. I think it will be
found as interesting a document as that which
has gone before.</p>

<p>The Order of Evacuation read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">General Headquarters</span>, December 21,
1915. The Commander-in-Chief desires to express
to all ranks in the Dardanelles Army his
unreserved appreciation of the way in which the
recent operations, ending in the evacuation of
Anzac and “Suvla” positions, have been carried
to an issue successful beyond his hopes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
arrangements made for withdrawal, and for
keeping the enemy in ignorance of the operation
which was taking place, could not have been
improved. The General Officer Commanding
the Dardanelles Army, and the General Officers
Commanding the Australian and New Zealand
and the 9th Army Corps, may pride themselves
on an achievement without parallel in the
annals of war. The Army and Corps Staff,
divisional and subordinate Commanders of
their staff, and the Naval and Military Beach
Staffs, proved themselves more than equal to
the most difficult task that could have been
thrown upon them. Regimental officers, non-commissioned
officers and men carried out,
without a hitch, the most trying operation which
soldiers can be called upon to undertake&mdash;a
withdrawal in the face of the enemy&mdash;in a manner
reflecting the highest credit on the discipline
and soldierly qualities of the troops.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to call this achievement
one without parallel. To discharge and withdraw
from a bold and active enemy is the most
difficult of all military operations; and in this
case the withdrawal was effected by surprise,
with the opposing forces at close grips&mdash;in
many cases within a few yards of each other.
Such an operation, when succeeded by a re-embarkation
from an open beach, is one for which
military history contains no precedent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>
<p>During the past months the troops of Great
Britain and Ireland, Australia and New Zealand,
Newfoundland and India fighting side by
side have invariably proved their superiority
over the enemy, have contained the best fighting
troops in the Ottoman Army in their front,
and have prevented the Germans from employing
their Turkish allies against us elsewhere.</p>

<p>No soldier relishes undertaking a withdrawal
from before the enemy. It is hard to leave
behind the graves of good comrades, and to
relinquish positions so hardly won and so gallantly
maintained as those we have left. But
all ranks in the Dardanelles Army will realize
that in this matter they were but carrying out
the orders of his Majesty’s Government, so
that they might in due course be more usefully
employed in fighting elsewhere for their King,
their country and the Empire.</p>

<p>There is one only consideration&mdash;what is best
for the furtherance of the common cause. In
that spirit the withdrawal was carried out, and
in that spirit the Australian and New Zealand
and the 9th Army Corps have proved, and will
continue to prove, themselves second to none as
soldiers of the empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
There was also posted for our information
an exchange of telegrams between King George
and Sir Charles Monro, Commander-in-Chief
of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force,
which should also be given here.</p>

<p>From Buckingham Palace came the following
to Sir Charles Monro:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It gives me the greatest satisfaction to hear
of the successful evacuation of “Suvla” and
“Anzac” without loss of troops or guns. Please

his command my congratulations upon the able
manner in which they have carried out so difficult
an operation.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">George, R. I.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>And the reply was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And on the same date was received from the

Monro and duly posted:</p>

<p>In the evacuation of “Anzac,” I had the
honor, reserved for the men who had first
landed, of being with those who left the tragic
strip of territory the last. I was not a passenger
on the very last barge, but if I recall
correctly, about the third from the last. We
went aboard the transport, <i>Andrines</i>.</p>

<p>I still had sixty men in my charge, but as I
looked over them as they filed up the gangplank
into the <i>Andrines</i>, the thought suddenly
came to me&mdash;it really had not occurred to me
before&mdash;that of all the men in my command
there was not one of the original sixty who had
left the <i>Euripides</i> with me for the landing at
Gallipoli. Only twelve of the original sixty
that I was ever again able to hear from had
survived the blowing up of the barge and the
barbed-wire obstacles. Of the twelve who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
made my little company in the “sangar” we
erected on the first ridge of X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. beach,
there was not one left. Four had been killed,
the others so badly injured that they had to be
taken to “Restville,” the hospital that had been
organized in one of the dug-outs blasted in the
stone ridges just above the sands.</p>

<p>It came to me that I also had not wholly escaped.
My hand still showed the thread of
the surgeon’s stitches binding my wound received
in the attack of Lone Pine. But, of
course, this injury was trivial. It was, after
all, for me a mild initiation to what was yet to
come.</p>

<p>With a small convoy of torpedo destroyers,
submarines, hydroplanes, our fleet of transports
with about 30,000 tired Anzacs made
Alexandria, where we were marched to “Rest
Camp.” It was just about what we needed
after our strenuous months in Gallipoli. Some
of our wounded were taken with us to Alexandria,
others were sent to Malta, cases of shellshock
decided to be curable to the special hospitals
in England, and cases that were despaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of were sent back to Australia, every effort
being made in their transportation to get them
home in time for farewell meetings with those
dear to them.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was in the best of health.
And I was most eager to introduce a weapon
of my invention&mdash;an armlet bayonet, to the
army authorities. This effort which took me
from Alexandria to London was not, however,
to keep me more than six weeks from the big
fight.</p>

<p>I had every reason by practical test to have
faith in this armlet bayonet. It had a steel
bracelet which fitted the forearm with an extension
of two forks clasping the upper arm. On
this brace was hinged a steel “T”. The top
of the “T” formed a bar to be gripped in the
hand. The tail of the “T” was the blade of
attack. This blade was seven and one-half
inches long.</p>

<p>My recommendation for it was that it was
an ideal weapon for the hand-to-hand fighting
which trench warfare and patrol encounters
were constantly demanding. It had its special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
adaptation for English and Anzacs, all of
whom have some knowledge of boxing, just
as it would also be admirable for American
fighters with whom boxing is familiar from
boyhood.</p>

<p>I knew that the Ghurkas, when they got
at the Germans in the first part of the war,
using their short knives, demoralized them.
The German is not a natural boxer and his
gymnasiums give him no training in this art of
self-defense. He is too much of an automaton
ever to make a boxer. Thus, I figured my armlet
bayonet would be a weapon invaluable in
engagements where men came hand to hand,
especially the surprise engagements of night
raids in No Man’s Land. This I had myself
shown to my own satisfaction by actual experience.
And the use of this new and, as it were,
“surprise” weapon met its due appreciation in
mention in Government despatches.</p>

<p>But when it came to securing its formal adoption
by the Government, I had a disappointment.
I received permission from Gen. Birdwood
to present the matter to the Australian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Minister of Defense, and was given the necessary
authority to proceed to England and put
my weapon before the Imperial authorities in
London.</p>

<p>There I saw Col. Buckley, Australian military
adviser, who was keenly interested, and
brought it to the notice of the chiefs of the
Bureau of Trench Inventions. Col. Burns of
this bureau gave the weapon his hearty endorsement,
but said the Government had no facilities,
so entirely was every means already commandeered,
to produce these special weapons in any
great number. He advised me, if my means
availed, to have some privately manufactured
for use in future training of trench fighters, and
that the government would gladly purchase
them.</p>

<p>This I did within two weeks, having meanwhile
had the honor of receiving a commission
as lieutenant in the army, and with this promotion
from the ranks, being assigned to the historic
“Oxford and Bucks” (Oxfordshire and
Buckshire) Light Infantry. The regular battalions
of this old regiment were already in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
France, but my assignment was to assist in the
training of the reserve battalions.</p>

<p>With the Oxfords and Bucks my duty was the
special training of two hundred and fifty young
Jews, mostly from London, who had been
brought into service through the patriotic endeavors
of Major Lionel de Rothschild. They
were boys from all walks of life&mdash;rich lads and
poor lads, and their race can be most justly
proud of their subsequent performances.</p>

<p>They were as keenly patriotic as any Englishmen
could be, and although with few exceptions,
war was not an occupation of which they would
have made a choice they were convinced of their
duty to defend the country, the gravity of the
situation and were therefore very eager and
wonderfully quick to learn. I had the armlet
bayonet of my invention made in sufficient
quantities to supply them all and gave them special
instruction in its use, and they were afterward
to make frequent demonstrations of its
effectiveness.</p>

<p>When these Jewish boys went into action
their courage was splendid. I could write sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
to make another book if I were to set
down the individual stories of their bravery
and devotion. Perhaps I can do them ample
justice, however, with the simple statement that
of the two hundred and fifty who flung themselves
into the trench fighting in France, there
were, when I was sent home crippled in the winter
of 1916, but thirty survivors.</p>

<p>Their training with the other battalions of
Oxfords and Bucks was conducted at Salisbury
Plains, Windmill Hill. The Government always
respects the religious faith of its soldiers.
It is particular that military life shall not prevent
proper observance of creed. The Jewish
boys had their rabbi, had their opportunities to
observe their fasts and feast days, and were
fed in a manner ordered by the orthodox regulations
of their faith.</p>

<p>I had them under my instruction only four
weeks when orders came for sailing to Europe,
and I soon, therefore, found myself back on the
battlefield&mdash;this time of Flanders.</p>

</div>

<p>I was soon to find out the difference between
fighting Turks and fighting Germans. The
Turk will fight you like the devil, but he is a
sportsman. He is incapable of the treacheries
and ghoulish tricks of the German. He abhors
attacking the helpless. I say this with full
knowledge of the Armenian cruelties and outrages.
I can only speak of my own knowledge.
I am writing of how the Turks behaved in Gallipoli.
Within two months&mdash;yes, less&mdash;as far
as I was concerned in my capacity of lieutenant
I had decided that where Germans were concerned
there should be no quarter. One of my
best men had been murdered because I had been
deceived into showing mercy to a group of Germans
in a dug-out. Germans falsely surrendering,
with hands up-raised and whining cries of
“Kamerad” had formed behind a small company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of mine and sought to stab us in the back.
Besides in these next two months I was to be
an eye-witness to the truth of the many accusations
that the Germans were guilty of atrocities
fit to burn horror into human minds forever.</p>

<p>The reserve battalion of the “Oxfords and
Bucks” with other battalions left Southampton
on the troop-ship, <i>Alexandria</i>, our military destination
being Rouen. There were several other
troopships in our company, a brisk convoy of
cruisers and destroyers and overhead a humming
fleet of seaplanes. But the only thing that
attacked us on the way over was sea-sickness.
It is a marvel of the British Navy that no disaster
has ever come upon these movements of
her fighting men across the Channel.</p>

<p>One of the boys of my Jewish company was
specially a victim of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal de mer</i>. He had
been a professional legerdemain artist in the
London music halls. He said ruefully that he
had never in his life brought so many things
out of a hat as he had out of himself on the
journey over. He said mournfully that he was
anxious to fight Germans, but would have much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
preferred that they had come to England to
get into the ring.</p>

<p>We landed at Havre, to an enthusiastic welcome
from old men, women and children. The
old men cheered us, the women wept and the
children scampered about our legs, throwing
kisses, and with irresistible smiles, shouted:</p>

<p>“Bon jour! Bon jour! Oh, bully beef! Oh,
biscuits!”</p>

<p>If there is one thing that has rung the gong
of popularity in France it is our English bully
beef. And next to that our biscuits. And what
could we do but share our beef and biscuits
with those kids with the wonderful smiles!</p>

<p>Old men, women and children had all apparently
learned the English slogan, “Are we
down-hearted? No!” They yelled it at us both
joyfully and tearfully, and we yelled back at
them with vigor, “<em>NO!</em> <em>NO!</em> NO!”</p>

<p>Military transportation was working smoothly
as oil, and without delay my own contingent
and some 3,000 others were rolled along to
Rouen. We were sent to camp No. 55, Infantry
Base Depot, a part of the 48th division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Territorials, Sixth Army Corps, Major-General
Fanshaw, commanding. Other pens, infinitely
greater than mine, have already depicted the
devastation in pretty Belgium and beautiful little
France. But the sights from the car windows
stirred great waves of pity across my heart because
some ten years before, practically in my
boyhood, I had traveled these fair countries on
a tour of military observation, and could appreciate
how terrible and large had been the
wounds inflicted.</p>

<p>Our particular camp was in Plugstreat.</p>

<p>I have said that it was the reports of Belgium
atrocities which mainly made the motive
for the great outpouring of Australian manhood
into the fray. We had heard these stories
and believed them. On March 16th, when we
entered the village of St. Elois, I saw with my
own eyes that these stories which had come to
Australia were not lies. My first confrontation
with the shocking facts was when in this
village. We came upon a shattered convent. I
cannot tell you its name because whatever inscription
had been on the building was smashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in the general wreck. But the ancient archway
of the entrance still stood, and on the heavy,
iron-bound door was the “exhibit” in the case.
It was the nude body of the Mother Superior.
The villagers so identified her. She had been
nailed to the door. She had been crucified. In
the ruins we brought out the bodies of four
nuns, unspeakably mutilated. Their bodies had
been stabbed and slashed each more than one
hundred times. They had gone to martyrdom
resisting incredible brutes. They had fought
hard, the blond hair of their assassins clutched
in their dead hands.</p>

<p>In this same village we found a white-haired
blacksmith&mdash;he must have been all of seventy
years&mdash;tied to his anvil. His hands had been
beaten to a pulp. They were held together by
a bayonet thrust through his wrists. And on
his anvil, weighted with a horseshoe, was a note
in German which read:</p>

<p>“You will never shoe another horse belonging
to our enemies.”</p>

<p>I was shortly afterward to kill a German on
whom I found a letter evidently just written and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
ready for mailing wherein he told of a score of
atrocities in which he had participated. He described
the horrors as “great sport.”</p>

<p>One sprightly paragraph told of murdering
four women at St. Julien while carrying out
orders to loot all homes of every ornament and
article of practical device containing brass, steel
or copper. In this instance, as of others, he said
the looting had been “great sport,” a phrase he
seemed very fond of. But quite astonishingly
his heart had been moved when the four women,
one of whom they shot and the other three they
bayoneted, had fallen on their knees and begged
for mercy. He wrote that he was rather uneasy
in his mind about that, but at the same
time said that he had gathered from their home
some very valuable and interesting “souvenirs.”
Good God! “Souvenirs!”</p>

<p>My first contact with the Germans was at
Whytecheat. I was given 80 men with instructions
to take the “skyline” trench ahead.
A skyline trench means just what it says&mdash;the
enemy trench on the horizon. It was a night
attack. It was a dangerous trench. The Warwicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
had three days before taken it and then
been blown to annihilation. This sort of
thing was constantly happening, I was told.
The British with bayonets could rout any
bunch of Germans out of any trench. But
at that time German artillery was far superior.
As a matter of fact at that time the English
batteries were given daily only six shells for
each gun and barrage fire was unknown. No
British gun might fire a shell without a particular
objective view. There could be no
general storm of shells sent at any suspected
point.</p>

<p>It was necessary for my commanders to know
what was beyond that first-line trench, what
there might be in machine-gun and “pill-box”
emplacements, how strong a force might meet
a general charge of our special contingent.</p>

<p>As a trained soldier, I was therefore detailed
to make this raid. No Man’s Land at this
junction of the fighting line was fully 500 yards
wide.</p>

<p>The Germans had so effectually blasted all
other attacks on the skyline trench, and our artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
had been so weak in its retorts that the
enemy figured themselves secure. No star-shells
were glaring over No Man’s Land as we made
our way across. But we were cautious. It took
us all of three hours, starting at midnight, before
we came to the first line of enemy barbed-wire.
We nipped it down successfully and still
without discovery went through the second wire
barrier.</p>

<p>But by this time the Germans were awake.
They started everything they had at us in the way
of rifle- and machine-gun fire, but the only men
of my company who hesitated were the ten who
were shot down. We got at them with the
bayonet and they didn’t like it. In less than
fifteen minutes we had turned them out of the
trench. And the second trench.</p>

<p>Then I was to have my first encounter with
the rottenness of German degeneracy. In the
second trench captured, we heard voices in a
dug-out and I called to know who were down
there&mdash;how many.</p>

<p>The answer came up:</p>

<p>“Six German wounded.”</p>

<div id="ip_120" class="figcenter" style="width: 607px;"><img src="images/i_fp_120.jpg" width="607" height="407" alt="" /><div class="caption">Bringing in prisoners</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
I believed them.</p>

<p>I detailed Platoon Sergeant O’Harper to go
into the trench and see what could be done for
the wounded.</p>

<p>I got a shock right afterward. It was
O’Harper’s cry:</p>

<p>“The damned dogs have stabbed me!”</p>

<p>So ten of us followed O’Harper into the dug-out
and “cleaned up.” There were nine Germans
down there and none of them had a
scratch until we got at them.</p>

<p>I am afraid I ceased thinking of Germans as
human beings from that time. I may as well
frankly admit that through all my experiences
in trench fighting since then, my habit became
that of calling into a dug-out:</p>

<p>“How many men are down there?”</p>

<p>If the answer came (let us say) “Six,” we
would throw three bombs into the dug-out and
call:</p>

<p>“Here&mdash;share these among you.”</p>

<p>All my bombers had instructions to do the
same.</p>

<p>We didn’t hold that trench very long. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
don’t think it was more than an hour. Information
regarding the attack had been sent back
to the German artillery and the two trenches
we had captured were sent heaving into the air.
My men were slaughtered all around me. But
their sacrifice was not in vain because I had been
able to judge and estimate for the information
of my commanders the lay-out and strength of
that particular position. I had sent a messenger
back with my report and rough sketches. I
hoped to hold the trench until reinforcements
might come at dawn. But it was useless for the
rest of us (I was afterward to find out that
only twenty-five were left of my original eighty)
to remain in the face of certain death.</p>

<p>I ordered a retreat. German star-shells
were making day out of night in No Man’s
Land so we got together and dug in about one
hundred and fifty feet from the trench whence
we had fled. We camouflaged ourselves with
corpses only too readily at hand.</p>

<p>I sent back another messenger and secured
reinforcements of three machine-gun companies
and two hundred men. I hated the idea of giving
up those two trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
When daylight came, we were given another
German “treat.” Above the wreck of the skyline
trench bayonets stuck up and on them were
the severed heads, with horrible smiles under
their English caps, of twenty of my men.</p>

<p>When we saw that we all of us went into a
blind rage. We swept across a narrow strip
and charged the Germans right and left. They
hate the bayonet. They will march shoulder
to shoulder with astounding doggedness against
the most withering fire. But the cold steel is
not for Hans.</p>

<p>We drove them out in less than ten minutes.
But they had other “things” to show us in those
trenches as to the treatment put upon our men.
We found four of our boys crucified to the
doors of dug-outs and we found others of our
dead whose corpses had been horribly and obscenely
outraged.</p>

<p>I never heard of a German after that who
got any mercy from the Oxfords and Bucks.</p>

<p>We had to give those trenches up. The Germans’
big guns came after us within half an
hour and our own artillery had nothing with
which to reply. But we stayed there long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
enough to take the heads of our boys off the
bayonets, their bodies down from the doors and
to give them burial as best we might. Also
under a demoniac fire, stretcher bearers took
away a small, smashed soldier I had fallen
over in a shell-hole at the close approach to
the German trench the night before. When
I fell over him he moved and I grabbed him
by the throat, not knowing whether he was
friend or enemy. However, there was no resistance
and I instinctively felt that I had in
my hands a weak and wounded man. I let go
his throat and he gasped:</p>

<p>“Warwick!”</p>

<p>He was only a little chap, scarcely twenty,
and was all broken up. He had a broken arm,
both legs had been broken and several of his
ribs. He had been caught in the fall of a great
upheaval of earth and stone shot forth by one
of the German two-hundred-pound shells, but
had managed to crawl out into the air and wriggle
his way to a shell-hole. In this shell-hole
he had lain for nearly four days. His emergency
ration had sustained him, but he was mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
with thirst and pitifully unnerved. He threw
his arms around my neck like a child and begged
me not to leave him. I gave him drink. I had
to lie to him, telling him that I was going back
to send for an ambulance when in reality I had
to “carry on” with my men. I left my emergency
rations with him. And I was particular
to make a mental picture of the location of the
shell-hole in which the boy had found shelter
and the following day was able to send him
stretcher bearers. You get a particular interest
in such cases and I am glad to be able to say
this lad went safely to “Blighty” and lived.</p>

</div>

<p>My first big adventure in No Man’s Land
occurred at Plugstreat in the Flanders campaign.
I was sent out on patrol duty with five
men in my command. For the war front it was
a very quiet night. Guns were silent. Star-shells
were absent. The enemy evidently didn’t
expect anything of us nor we of them.</p>

<p>But what might be happening in that streak
between enemy trenches that constituted No
Man’s Land was never a certainty to any commander
on either side. They detailed me, therefore,
to find out if the Germans were attempting
to move in any way toward our position.
I was to find out if there had been a movement
or advance of any kind such as might be
suggested by a line of trench newly thrown
out.</p>

<p>In so far as the progress of my five men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
myself were concerned it was easy going. We
advanced well across the equator of No Man’s
Land without detection and much further.</p>

<p>It was, as a matter of fact, all too quiet. We
had gone too far without detection in so far as
my judgment kept warning me. I was frankly
afraid that we were walking into a trap. The
Germans rarely left the dividing line of No
Man’s Land unguarded. To be sure, I had
worked my men from our own trenches and
through a land of stubble and hillocks. Most
cautiously we had hidden from time to time
in our advance to note if anything moved ahead.</p>

<p>No Man’s Land in its aspect in this locality
presented a hard problem for night observation,
in that many small trees had been smashed by
artillery fire, leaving stumps that an observer in
the night might take to mean a sentry.</p>

<p>One such object appeared to me because of
its absolute immobility to be surely a tree trunk.
I am mighty glad I didn’t jump at my first conclusion.</p>

<p>I told my men to “get down,” which brought
them prostrate to the ground. I ordered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to hold that position until I could find out what
the strange figure in the night might mean.</p>

<p>I crawled toward it and crawled for at least
twenty yards, before I was positive that it was
no shell-broken tree. I saw the man move. He
was not moving watchfully but wearily. He had
a bayoneted rifle in his hand, and as I moved
toward him he stuck the bayonet point in the
turf and leaned on the butt in the manner of a
man thoroughly tired out.</p>

<p>It was all very silent in No Man’s Land and
I had to move with extreme caution particularly
to avoid ruffling the gravel over the
stones. There wasn’t much shrubbery left
which I might crackle in my advance. Such as
was there was so dampened by rains and mud
that you could pass over it without making a
sound.</p>

<p>So I got to this man without his having the
slightest suspicion of my approach. And it was
the meanest job I had to perform of the war.
Because when I got to him I saw that he was
really standing at the top of a tunnel. What
this tunnel might mean I did not know. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of course, I knew that it led somewhere and
that at the end of it this single soldier would
have reinforcements.</p>

<p>Other men who had gone over No Man’s
Land before me had given information which
guided me in this situation. Such sapper tunnels
had been frequently made in No Man’s Land
by the Germans to meet and defeat British patrols.
The usual thing had been if you saw a
man standing in No Man’s Land to shoot at
him. He was supposed to be wary enough to
detect your advance and while jumping down
into his tunnel protection to let go a discharge
of his rifle which was a signal to the other end
of the tunnel of an enemy patrol approach. At
this other end from twelve to eighteen men
would be stationed. The single man at one end
of the tunnel was merely bait to betray the scout
patrol into firing at him. At which the Germans
would send half of their force through
the tunnel to support their single sentry while
the other half at the other end of the excavation
would take to the surface, speed along and
come on top of the discovered entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
tunnel. In this wise they would have the enemy
patrol surrounded.</p>

<p>I had never been in one of these engagements
before, but I had been thoroughly well
instructed as to what you must look out for.
This sentry would have been a simple mark
for a revolver shot. He did not know that
I was there. He stood at ease, a perfect
target. But the report of a pistol shot would
have been as perfectly a report to his comrades
of our presence.</p>

<p>To get him, as I have learned in America
to say, “right,” my duty was to knife him. I
got up behind him all undetected. I never
felt such miserable hesitation or qualms of conscience
in my life. I had lost all revulsion at
destroying human life when it was German
human life, because I had already seen that they
rather took an insane joy in killing their fellow
man. But to sneak up behind one and stab him
to death was a very difficult thing to do. I had
to bring into my mind the reason and cause for
my act. There were dead men right behind me
in No Man’s Land to create a moral support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
And when I felt this I did get up and without
hesitation stabbed him in the back of the
neck. I stabbed him in the neck so that he might
not be able to make outcry.</p>

<p>Then I went back to my small force of men.
With the Germans at the other end of the tunnel
thus left unsuspecting the advantage was all
with us. I sent three men to follow the line of
this tunnel and, immediately, on sight of the
enemy give attack while I led my other two men
through the tunnel from the entrance where I
had slain the sentry. So thus we had reversed
the expected. When my men “on top” gave the
attack and the German patrol sought retreat
into their tunnel we met them with quick revolver
firing and bombs. And we killed all
but one. But he was shot six times and had
no chance to live. I’ll grant him he was
brave. We set him up with such first-aid
articles as we had and then I tried to pump him
as to the position behind. He wouldn’t tell.
He smiled at me and thanked me for having his
wounds bandaged. But he was a square and
nervy patriot and wouldn’t talk at all. I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
not attempt the persuasion of telling him that
his life could be saved nor did I attempt to prevail
upon such gratefulness as he may have felt
for our attention to him. Not but what I hated
him; not but what I detested him as the type of
which I had sworn to myself deserved no mercy.
Yet the man died with a steady loyal look in
his eyes and you cannot help but respect that.</p>

<p>The discovery of this night was of extreme
value in that it informed my officers of the
higher command of a German engineering plan
to undermine our position.</p>

<p>From the sentry I killed and from two others
of the men killed we possessed ourselves of
papers of interest to my superiors. And also
from the lieutenant killed who was in command
of this squad in No Man’s Land I took documents
which I will herewith reproduce in the
belief that the reader may find particular interest
in a German official document designed to
instruct their own men against the dangers of
the gas attack which they began and out of
which pure necessity caused us to retaliate.
These papers had their value to the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
commanders by way of guidance in future gas
attacks.</p>

</p>

<p>From all parts of the Army suggestions have
been submitted to Army H.&nbsp;Q. for weakening
the force or even entirely neutralizing the effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
of a hostile gas attack, apart from the
use of respirators and oxygen breathing apparatus.
These suggestions show what trouble
the commanders of all ranks have taken to advise
means of protection for our troops against
the effects of the enemy’s gas. Many of the
suggested devices are theoretically practical. In
many cases actual experiments have given successful
results. Nevertheless, none of these devices
can be employed, for the simple reason
that before they can take effect the enemy’s gas
has reached our troops. Further, the employment
of such devices is <i>not necessary</i>. The
combined fire of our Artillery, Infantry, Machine
Guns, Minenwerfer and Hand Grenades
breaks up the gas clouds, and the respirators
then afford complete protection against such
gas as may reach our position.</p>

<p><i>The aim and object of all training in combating
gas attack must be to instill into the troops complete
confidence in the fact that our fire and the
respirators afford complete protection against
the effects of gas.</i> The possession of this confidence
by every man is the surest guarantee that,
in the event of a hostile gas attack, he will remain
calmly at his post, allowing the gas cloud
to pass over him.</p>

<p>The following notes have been drawn up in
accordance with this view and should be issued
to all Officers and Men. The notes lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the lines upon which the Systematic training of
the troops is to be carried out. The system of
training and the scheme of actual defense are
briefly described below. I request all commanders
to exercise a constant supervision over this
training and to use every means in their power
to attain the object described above.</p>

<h4>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMBATING HOSTILE GAS ATTACKS</h4>

<p class="in0">(1) All troops in the trenches must be fully
equipped with respirators; the respirators must
always be kept in such a condition that they are
ready for immediate use. Officers and Medical
Officers, must by frequent inspections, satisfy
themselves as to the above.</p>

<p class="in0">(2) It is not desirable that the men should retain
their respirators when in rest billets. When
troops are going to rest billets, respirators will
be withdrawn from them, preferably under
Company arrangements; during the period of
rest they will be examined and stored by the
Medical personnel and re-issued just before the
men return to the trenches.</p>

<p class="in0">(3) In order that the respirators may be
always ready for use small quantities of anti-gas
solution and water will be kept in readiness
by the Medical personnel in front line for the
purpose of re-moistening the respirators.</p>

<p class="in0">(4) Machine gunners, artillery observers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
when possible all officers in the front line will be
issued with oxygen breathing apparatus (Selbstretter).
It is desirable that men who are used
to working with the apparatus in peace time
should be detailed to assist artillery observers
and machine gunners in the use of the apparatus,
to enable the latter to carry out their particular
duties undisturbed. Special stress is laid
on the necessity for affording every possible protection
to the machine gunners and artillery observers.</p>

<p class="in0">(5) The Pulmotors and large oxygen apparatus
must be kept in readiness at suitable points
behind the front&mdash;the situation of all this apparatus
should be known to the troops.</p>

<p class="in0">(6) As soon as the weather conditions favor a
hostile gas attack, all commanders must exercise
the utmost vigilance. All the above mentioned
protective appliances will be once more
inspected as regards numbers and conditions.
In particular all preparations should be completed
so that, the moment a gas cloud appears,
fire may be opened by artillery, infantry, machine
guns, minenwerfer and hand grenades. At
the same time care should be taken that equanimity
of troops is not disturbed by all these
preparations.</p>

<p class="in0">(7) At the first sure sign of an impending gas
attack a signal will be given for donning respirators
and opening fire. It is specially desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to direct enfilade fire on the area covered by
the gas.</p>

<p class="in0">(8) It is a mistake, before or at the beginning
of a gas attack, to leave only a weak garrison
in the front trenches and withdraw the remainder
of the troops into the support trenches, as
the effect of the gas will be equally felt in these.
It is almost equally mistaken, to allow the men
to withdraw laterally along the front trench.
It is imperatively necessary that every man
should remain in his place and commence firing.</p>

<p class="in0"><i>Headquarters VI Army.<br />

</p>

<h4><i>Notes</i></h4>

<p class="in0">(1) A hostile gas attack is only possible when
the wind is blowing toward our trenches and
then only in cloudy weather or darkness. A gas
attack cannot be carried out when the wind is
blowing in the other direction.</p>

<p class="in0">(2) None need fear a gas attack. The fire of
our artillery which in its retired position remains
unaffected by the combined fire of our infantry
machine guns and hand grenades, breaks
up the clouds and prevents the enemy from following
it up. Further the respirator affords
complete protection, it should therefore be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
on immediately a gas cloud appears, and fire
should be opened against the latter.</p>

<p class="in0">(3) The gas cloud can approach with great
rapidity, therefore the respirator should be rapidly
and correctly adjusted. Every man must
learn by repeated practice to adjust his respirator
quickly.</p>

<p class="in0">(4) The respirator must always be kept in perfect
order, they are only effective when damp;
the anti-gas solution can be obtained from Medical
personnel. Every man is responsible that
his respirator is ready for use.</p>

<p class="in0">(5) When the gas cloud appears, it is imperative
that every man remain in his place and
not take shelter in dug-outs and not withdraw to
a flank or to the rear.</p>

<p class="in0">(6) In case the respirator is lost or becomes
unserviceable a substitute should be extemporized
immediately, a cloth containing damp
earth or a damp cloth should be firmly pressed
on nose and mouth. A makeshift respirator is
better than none.</p>

<p class="in0">(7) Should any man inhale the gas the Medical
Officers have apparatus ready at the dressing
stations which at once banish the ill effects.</p>

<p class="in0">(8) Gas does not injure the eyes, at the most it
causes temporary irritation.</p>

<h4>INSTRUCTIONS IN THE CASE OF A HOSTILE GAS ATTACK</h4>

<p>In the case of a hostile gas attack, in addition
to opening the heaviest possible fire, the main
effort must be directed toward preventing the
gas cloud from reaching our lines, or at any
rate breaking it up to such an extent that it is
harmless. This result is best obtained by creating
upward currents of air which are most easily
produced by means of highly inflammable material
placed close in front of our position. The
most suitable materials for this purpose are hay,
straw, old sacks, wood shavings, etc., soaked in
paraffin, etc., so that they can be readily ignited
even in wet weather.</p>

<p>On the approach of the gas cloud the fire
must be lighted by some reliable means of ignition.
According to a statement of a prisoner
the French intend to combat the gas cloud by
the ignition of black powder.</p>

</p>

<p>Notes on the protective Measures to be taken
in case of a gas attack.</p>

<p class="in0 larger">1 PREPARATIONS.</p>

<p class="in0">(1) Heaps of inflammable materials soaked
with paraffin should be placed, if possible, at
several points in front of the position.</p>

<p class="in0">(2) A supply of the above materials should be
kept stored in the shelters, so that the fire can
be kept burning for about half an hour.</p>

<p class="in0">(3) Every man should be supplied with special
matches or other means of ignition which can
be relied on in a wind.</p>

<p class="in0">(4) Respirators must always be kept ready
for use.</p>

<p class="in0">(5) All oxygen apparatus must be maintained
in a serviceable condition (Individuals who are
equipped with such apparatus should be exercised
in its use).</p>

<h4>ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON THE APPROACH OF A GAS CLOUD</h4>

<p class="in0">(1) A heavy fire should be opened with guns,
machine guns, and rifles against the source of
the gas cloud.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
(2) The fires should be lighted all along the
front and kept burning.</p>

<p class="in0">(3) The respirators should be firmly placed
over nose and mouth as soon as the gas penetrates
the position.</p>

<p class="in0">(4) Breathing should only take place through
the moistened respirator.</p>

<p class="in0">(5) The gas cloud should be fanned upward
by means of waterproof cloths (ten squares).</p></blockquote>

<p>I was to be a lucky man in that there were
few branches of the war in which I did not have
experience until a German bomb laid me low at
Baupaume. I not only got an opportunity to do
my country service in the air as a military observer,
though it sent me on my first trip to
a hospital, but not so very long afterward
had the wildest and possibly more thrilling
experience in command of one of his Majesty’s
ground “dreadnoughts”&mdash;the famous tanks.</p>

<p>Mind you, I wouldn’t paint myself as so brilliant
and indispensable generally that the aviation
corps was trying to steal me from the infantry
and the special tank service from doing
duty in the air.</p>

<p>But it is to be recalled that I was a trained
soldier&mdash;that I had had ten years of study and
practice of military affairs. I must credit myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
with always having been ambitious. And so,
when war came I had several strings to my bow
that must surely prove of value. One of these
was the acquirement of an expert knowledge of
wireless telegraphy and telegraphy generally. I
had also picked up a considerable knowledge of
photography. And naturally I knew gunnery.
There was a dearth of men in the British air
service at the time competent for an observer’s
duty, scarcely more than half enough to man
the hundreds of aëroplanes that were being
turned out under forced pressure. For the battle
of the Somme was now under preparation and it
was not only desirable but imperative that Britain’s
aviators should take the mastery of the
air. Scores of other young officers like myself
possessing special qualifications for the work
were requisitioned from the other branches of
the army and put into intensive training as aviation
observers.</p>

<p>The tragedies of Gallipoli and Belgium I had
been through had not impaired me in any degree.
Shell-shock had not shattered my nerves,
physically I was in the best of shape and tests
of my vision met all requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
You can wager though that I said several
prayers during my practice flights. Once you
got up in the air, however, there would come
over you an amazing confidence in the trustworthiness
of the fragile planes and the roaring
motor.</p>

<p>The darts, loops, banks and volplaning that
had at first turned me somewhat dizzy, I found
myself getting used to. And there’s another
thing about flying. It’s when you get ’way up.
The further up you go, the less you think about
falling. Or if you do the vastness of the upper
regions simply takes all thoughts of self-importance
out of a man. You are such a midget
in the immensity after all. And you find yourself
figuring, “Well, suppose I do drop? What
a small thing I am anyway in this great world.”
And it sets you thinking of the millions of men
who have died in the great cause and to wondering
why you should imagine you must of
necessity be one of the lucky ones to escape.
Flying would even take the “swank” out of the
Kaiser or his booby-faced son.</p>

<p>For all that, however, there was one time in
every flight when I held my breath&mdash;when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
never quite got over being scared. That was the
landing. The observation machine we had, while
not so fast as some of the fighting flyers, was
nevertheless capable of about one hundred miles
an hour. When you are going at that pace, you
swallow a lot of wind whenever you attempt to
talk or rather shout. In machines of that speed,
as the reader is probably informed, they begin
to drop as soon as the pace goes under sixty
miles an hour. That means you have to make
your landing at a whooping, whizzing speed,
and if you are forced to a landing away from
your station and on rough ground, there will
usually be bruises in the adventure for you at
least. Lord bless me! But the earth would
suddenly seem to be coming up at you fast&mdash;at
express-train speed. Even the flyer will admit
to you that it is the hardest, most nerve-racking
feature of his nervous job. Just when
you bring the wheels of the machine on a level
with the ground there must be a swift upward
turn&mdash;it is a ticklish proceeding, requiring
“feel” as much as scientific knowledge of the
levers, and if you don’t do the thing rightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
your plane will balk viciously, jabbing its nose
into the ground, rearing, probably somersaulting,
possibly smashing itself and you, too.</p>

<p>I soon came to have absolute confidence in my
flyer, however. He was Lieut. Reggie Larkin
and of my Gallipoli comrades, the Australians.
He is now a youngster of not more than twenty
years. But he had soon shown in training the
peculiar faculties which are as much artistic
and psychological as scientific, for the making
of a fine flyer. He was always superbly confident
of himself when he took to the air, a confidence
that was contagious and of great aid
to a novice like myself. And of his bravery
I have a stirring account to give before this
chapter closes.</p>

<p>As for me, after the first two or three training
flights, I had not much time to think of myself.
I had to make a showing in acquiring the
use of the set, cinema camera with its purpose
of acquiring continuous bird’s-eye views of the
enemy’s positions and in mastering the use of
aërial guns and the newer problems which they
presented. This included the study of plaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
models of landscapes with special reference to
promontories the better to judge altitudes and
for gun-aiming at what lay below your sweeping
aëroplane.</p>

<p>Now I come to my most thrilling aërial adventure&mdash;my
trip through hell in the clouds, a
battle with a whirling Fokker, at that time Germany’s
crack fighting plane, of gaining what
we went out and up after and of the superb
courage of Lieut. Reggie Larkin in guiding the
machine through a tempest of attack though his
face was ripped and bleeding because of shrapnel
wounds.</p>

<p>On the line between Albert and Orvilles
there was an especially vicious, strong battery.
It had done deadly and ferocious work on our
trenches. It was the more dangerous in that
it evidently possessed a perfect camouflage of
natural foliage. Several attempts that had been
made to spot it had failed. One of our
observation planes had been smashed by the
“archeys,” and its crew killed in the attempt to
discover the exact location of this battery.</p>

<p>On a morning when the battery had developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
an especially deadly activity, Larkin and
I were sent up to hunt it. We made rapidly
into the air above our own sector, soon reaching
an altitude of 20,000 feet. Before descending
over the enemy’s territory we thought best to
investigate the upper regions to see if the Boche
had any of his own men up with the plan of performing
their favorite method of attack at this
time. This would be done by the speedy Fokkers,
who would take high altitude, and hidden
behind the clouds, occasionally dart forth into
the clear, looking for victims. Were such discerned,
the Fokker would come plunging down
upon its prey, letting go everything it had in the
way of gun-fire and frequently blasting the objective
aëroplane into a total wreck. This is the
method that the young American crack, Lufberry,
has used with havoc on the Germans.
He carries three guns, two that shoot through
the propeller and one over his head.</p>

<p>If there was any pouncing of this character
to be done, Larkin and I had decided that we
would take a shot at the trick ourselves, but
first, of course, with the consideration of escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
detection altogether if we could, for our
most important task was to send back the
knowledge of the location of the big, murderous
battery.</p>

<p>The upward tendency of sound is almost as
powerful as telegraphy. You can actually hear
the chirping of birds at an altitude of more than
1,000 feet. But when your own motor and
propeller are humming and throbbing into your
ears, it is hard, if not impossible, to hear the
other fellow’s.</p>

<p>Evidently the enemy’s observation balloons
had spotted us for all our efforts at hiding behind
the clouds at the dizzy altitude of 20,000
feet and had given the alarm. Suddenly a Fokker
came cutting through the mist not more than
fifty yards away from us. I looked to see
others come soaring at us and was convinced
there were probably machines below ready to
trap us should we seek flight by descent as it
would be likely for us to do from such a great
altitude. But at any rate only our single enemy
was in sight.</p>

<p>There wasn’t an instant wasted by either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
us in maneuvering. We had come to such close
quarters there wasn’t much chance. There was
only one flyer in the Fokker and he let go at us
with his machine guns the second he saw us.
But in spite of his promptness, I appeared to
have beat him to the fire. Or perhaps, it was
at the very same time we got at it. How on
earth such a storm of spitting bullets were sent
at me without my being hit, is still a matter of
wonderment to me.</p>

<p>His bullets did tear through one of our wings
and it was turned and crippled slightly, but not
enough to bring us down. Larkin maneuvered
swiftly above the Fokker and I knew what for.
It was a chance for me to use my bombs. I let
four go at the German in as many seconds.</p>

<p>They did the work. We saw the Boche’s
Fokker stagger, could make out the smashing
of its engine in a sheet of a flame, saw the complete
blowing away of one of the enemy’s wings
and if the pilot himself was not blown to
pieces then and there he must surely have been
killed a few minutes later for the Fokker went
plunging to earth like a dead thing and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
when we came out of the clouds ourselves to
take observations for the location of the battery,
we saw the wreck of the aëroplane near an
enemy trench. It was reduced to a mere heap.</p>

<p>I thought, right after we got the German,
that our own time had come. For our aëroplane
began falling with a rapidity to make you gasp
for breath. It was describing the most eccentric
spirals and plunging almost as dizzily as the
Fokker. I yelled at Lieut. Larkin, though hopelessly,
my voice sounded so small. I was dazed.
Yet he told me afterward that my voice
reached him. It caused him to turn his head.
For the first time I saw his bloody, wounded
face. I saw also that his hands had fallen away
from the controls and that he was reaching out
helplessly toward them.</p>

<p>Of course, when we came into sight out of the
clouds the enemy had started all the archeys, and
shrapnel from a bursting shell had torn Larkin’s
face cruelly. The shock had knocked him
out for a brief instant. I admit having uttered
a swift, frantic prayer as I saw him reaching
out so feebly to regain his controls.</p>

<p>But with his splendid courage, he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
braced. We were about 1700 feet above the
enemy lines when he again succeeded taking direction
of the machine. To have tried to climb
directly up again in the enemy fire must have
meant our destruction. We would have been
too fair a target. Instead, Larkin boldly
shot straight downward directly toward the
aërial batteries and the trenches. They thought
us hit and falling and fled from their places in
fear of being caught in the crash.</p>

<p>Larkin shot his plane not fifty feet above the
Boche trenches, but none of them took even
so much as a rifle shot at us. They either ran
or cowered in the trenches as we swept past.
Then he shot up again, cleared a small, wooded
section of knolls and dropped behind them, thus
successfully getting out of the range of the
archeys.</p>

<p>Larkin turned once again to me his blood-reddened
countenance. This time he grinned
bravely, coolly.</p>

<p>“It’s quite all right, Dave,” he called. “The
wounds are nothing. I’m feeling quite fit again.
We’ve got to spot that battery.”</p>

<p>So up we went. We mounted some 15,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
feet. The archeys promptly and furiously got
after us again. They spread a circular fire about
us. That is the way the archeys go after aëroplanes,
not shooting directly at them but trying
to surround them with a fire that must smash
them whichever direction they may take in
seeking to escape destruction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was working my camera for all
it was worth and peering upon and around the
country with my glasses. There were several
small clutters of heavily wooded knolls marking
the landscape below us and the rattle and roar
of the archeys were suddenly joined by the
crash and boom of bigger guns and the distant
reply of our own batteries.</p>

<p>I began banging my wireless exultantly. For
down in the largest clutter of knolls, under a
cloak of foliage so naturally dense and perhaps
artificially assisted and affording full concealment
ordinarily, I had seen that instant sudden
sparks or flares as emitted from the throats
of the big batteries’ guns in action.</p>

<p>Additionally, I dropped red lights visible in
the daylight, over the battery’s position, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
was hardly necessary, for my wireless was working
perfectly and I soon was giving them the
enemy’s range.</p>

<p>But the first fire from our side was poor and
I was therefore excited and indignant.</p>

<p>“What the devil’s the matter with you?” I
wirelessed, repeating the instructions. “If you
can’t do better than that, I’ll have to get the
infantry to teach you how to shoot!”</p>

<p>I chuckled to think how the artillerymen
would like that.</p>

<p>It was enough to make them try a shot at us.</p>

<p>But a minute later a shell ripped right
through the trees that camouflaged the battery,
tearing a big gash in the concealment.</p>

<p>“Bull’s eye!” I shot out into the air from
my key. “Give’m hell!”</p>

<p>With that Larkin started us for home with
the archeys spitting their rage but ineffectually.</p>

<p>But just the same something did happen that
made all a blackness for me until I woke up in
a clearing-station hospital just behind our lines.</p>

<p>Brave, old Larkin was the cause. He had
held his nerve and strength and never did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
he falter until we were home and within twenty
feet of the ground when he suddenly lurched
forward and was “out.” We crashed to the
ground and I also was “out.”</p>

<p>There wasn’t much the matter with me. I
was only pea green from bruises for a week.
But Larkin, poor chap, had two ribs and a leg
broken in addition to having suffered the shrapnel
wounds on his face.</p>

<span class="subhead">“<span class="smcap">Razzle Dazzle</span>”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was at Beaumont-Hamel, about September
16th, that I got my chance to command a
“tank.”</p>

<p>The dear girl was named “Razzle Dazzle.”
She was very young, having been in service only
three months, but rather portly. Matter of
fact, she weighed something over thirty tons.
And in no way could you call the dear little
woman pretty. She was a pallid gray and mud-splashed
when I got her and there was no grace
in the bulging curves of her steel shape. Or of
her conical top. Or her ponderous wheels.</p>

<p>The fact is that she showed every aspect
of being a bad, scrappy old dearie. The minute
I saw her in her lovely ugliness I knew she
would like trouble and lots of it. Her metabolism
was a marvel. She carried a six-hundred-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>horse-power
motor. And out of her gray steel
hoods protruded eight guns. An infernal old
girl, you can bet she was. All ready to make
battle in large quantities.</p>

<p>When I boarded “Razzle Dazzle” she
was full of dents. She had rocked around
among several trench charges. But the reason
for my assignment to her was prosaic. Her
captain had not been killed. He was just sick&mdash;some
stomach complaint. I was drafted on
an hour’s notice to the job, this, because of
long training in handling rapid-fire guns.</p>

<p>It was all new to me, but highly interesting.
My crew consisted of seven men&mdash;five of them
well experienced. And a black cat. Although
she was a lady-cat she had been named
“Joffre” and I can’t tell you why because I
never received any explanation on this point myself.
But “Joffre” was very friendly and insisted
on sitting either on my knee or shoulder
from the moment I sealed myself and my men
in the tank. We had our outlook from several
periscopes above the turret and from spy holes
in the turret itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
The order had come to me about one in the
morning, and it was nearly three when we
started lumbering out toward the enemy
trenches. We had about six hundred yards to
cover. I knew little or nothing of her motor
power or speed. My concern was with the efficiency
of the guns. She pumped and swayed
“across No Man’s Land” at about four miles
an hour. She groaned and tossed a great deal.
And in fact, made such poor progress that my
regiment, the Oxfords and Bucks, beat the old
dearie to the enemy lines. Our men were
among the barbed wire of the first line, fighting
it, cutting it, knocking it down before the old
“Razzle Dazzle” got into action.</p>

<p>But she “carried on” just the same. And
when she smote the barbed-wire obstacles, she
murdered them. She crushed those barriers to
what looked like messes of steel spaghetti.</p>

<p>Instead of sinking into trenches as I feared
she would, she crushed them and continued to
move forward. Of course, we were letting go
everything we had, and from my observation
hole, I could see the Germans didn’t like it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
They had put up something of a stand against
the infantry. But against the tank they were
quick to make their farewells. It was a still
black night, but under the star-shells we could
see them scurrying out of our way.</p>

<p>This was very sensible of them because we
were certainly making a clean sweep of everything
in sight and had the earth ahead throwing
up chocolate showers of spray as if the
ground we rode was an angry sea of mud.</p>

<p>Every man in the tank was shouting and
yelling with the excitement of the thing and we
were tossed up against each other like loosened
peas in a pod. Only Joffre remained perfectly
cool. Somehow she maintained a firm seat on
my swaying shoulder and as I glanced around
to peer at her she was calmly licking a paw
and then daintily wiped her face.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of a very clever camouflage of
tree branches and shrubbery a German machine-gun
emplacement was revealed. The bullets
stormed and rattled upon the tank. But they
did themselves a bad turn by revealing their
whereabouts, for we made straight for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
camouflage and went over that battery of machine
guns, crunching its concrete foundation as
if it were chalk.</p>

<p>Then we turned about and from our new position
put the Germans under an enfilade fire
that we kept up until every evidence was at hand
that the Oxfords and Bucks and supporting battalions
were holding the trenches.</p>

<p>But this was only preliminary work cut out
for the tank to do. I had special instructions
and a main objective. This was a sugar refinery.
It was a one-storied building of brick and
wood with a tiled roof. It had been established
as a sugar refinery by the Germans before the
war and when this occasion arose blossomed as
a fortress with a gun aimed out of every window.</p>

<p>To allow it to remain standing in hostile
hands would mean that the trenches we had
won could be constantly battered. Its removal
was most desirable. To send infantry against
it would have involved huge losses in life. The
tank was deemed the right weapon.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
And largely because “Razzle Dazzle” took
matters into her own hands. The truth is she
ran away.</p>

<p>We rocked and plowed out of the trenches
and went swaying toward the refinery. I
ordered the round-top sealed. And we beat
the refinery to the attack with our guns. But
they had seen us coming and every window facing
our way developed a working gun. There
were about sixteen such windows. They all
blazed at us.</p>

<p>My notion had been to circle the “sugar mill”
with “Razzle Dazzle” and shoot it up from all
sides. We were getting frightfully rapped by
the enemy fire, but there was apparently nothing
heavy enough to split the skin of the wild, old
girl. Our own fire was effective. We knocked
out all the windows and the red-tiled roof was
sagging. As I say, my notion was to circle the
“mill” and I gave orders accordingly. But the
“Razzle Dazzle’s” chauffeur looked at me in
distress.</p>

<p>“The steering gear’s off, sir,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
“Stop her then and we’ll let them have it
from here,” I ordered.</p>

<p>He made several frantic motions with the
mechanism and said:</p>

<p>“I can’t stop her, either.”</p>

<p>And the “Razzle Dazzle” carried out her
own idea of attack. She banged head-on into
the “mill.” She went right through a wide
doorway, making splinters of the door, she
knocked against concrete pillars, supports and
walls, smashing everything in her way and
bowled out of the other side just as the roof
crashed in and apparently crushed and smothered
all the artillery men beneath it.</p>

<p>On the way through, the big, powerful old
girl bucked and rocked and reared until we men
and the black cat inside her were thrown again
and again into a jumble, the cat scratching us
like a devil in her frenzy of fear.</p>

<p>Closed up in the tank as we were, we
could hear the roar and crash of the falling
“mill,” and from my observation port-hole I
could observe that it was most complete. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
place had been reduced to a mere heap. Not a
shot came out of it at us.</p>

<p>But still the “Razzle Dazzle” was having
her own way. Her motorist was signaling me
that he had no control of her. This was cheerful
intelligence because right ahead was a huge
shell crater. She might slide into it and climb
up the other side and out. I hoped so. But
she didn’t. She hit the bottom of the pit, tried
to push her way up and out, fell back, panted,
pushed up again, fell back and then just stuck
at the bottom of the well, throbbing and moaning
and maybe penitent for her recklessness.</p>

<p>Penitence wasn’t to do her any good. It
wasn’t five minutes later when the Germans had
the range of her and began smashing us with
big shells. I ordered my men to abandon her
and led them in a rush out of the crater and
into small shell holes until the storm of fire was
past.</p>

<p>When it was, “Razzle Dazzle” was a wreck.
She was cracked, distorted and shapeless. But
the runaway engine was still plainly to be heard
throbbing. Finally a last big shell sailed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
doughty tank and there was a loud bang and a
flare. Her oil reservoir shot up in an enormous
blaze.</p>

<p>“Razzle Dazzle” was no more. But she had
accounted for the “refinery.” And our infantry
had done the rest. The German position was
ours.</p>

<p>I was all enthusiasm for fighting “tanks.”
But my superiors squelched it. For when I
asked for command of a sister of “Razzle
Dazzle” next day, a cold-eyed aide said to me:</p>

<p>“One tank, worth ten thousand pounds, is as
much as any bally young officer may expect to
be given to destroy during his lifetime. Good
afternoon.”</p>

<p>He never gave me a chance to explain that
it was “Razzle Dazzle’s” own fault, how she
had taken things into her own willful control.
But he did try to give me credit for what
“Razzle Dazzle” had herself accomplished.
He said the destruction of the “sugar mill” had
been “fine work.”</p>

<p>I wonder what “Joffre” thought of it all. I
don’t remember seeing her when we fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the “tank,” except as something incredibly swift
and black flashed past my eyes as we thrust up
the lid. I sincerely hope she is alive and
well “somewhere in France.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Moquet Farm</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The name of Moquet Farm flashes vividly
to my memory a night of the bitterest, bloodiest
fighting I ever went through. It certainly
was the hell of war in its most intensive degree.
There were twenty-two hours of continuous
fighting with never a minute’s let-up in the gales
of deadly missiles.</p>

<p>We were holding Orvilles in preparation for
the great battle of the Somme and our immediate
objective was Thiepval. This Moquet
Farm, with its powerful batteries, presented a
particular obstacle, for it was directly in our
path on the road to Thiepval. It had to be
obliterated. But before we might move on
Moquet we must dispose of a sky-line trench
just ahead. The Farm lay three miles to the
right of this sky-line trench as we faced it.</p>

<p>If we could battle through those lines to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Moquet Farm and capture or put into retreat
the batteries that had been constantly and effectively
in use against us, it would mean that
we would make the whole German position untenable
and place ourselves in a position of
great advantage in preparation for the great
Somme drive.</p>

<div id="ip_168" class="figcenter" style="width: 605px;"><img src="images/i_fp_168.jpg" width="605" height="404" alt="" /><div class="caption">Waiting to “go over”</div></div>

<p>We went over the top at ten o’clock one
night from our own elaborately constructed
trenches. My regiment, the Oxfords and
Bucks, had been living in “Fifth Avenue.” I
had the hardest time keeping my own two
platoons in leash. From eight o’clock that
night they had known they were going over
the top, and after the usual ceremonies of
letter-writing to the dear ones at home, they
got so restive I could hardly hold them in the
trenches. They hadn’t been in action for nearly
a month and this hadn’t pleased them. The
very mildest-dispositioned of my men were actually
blood-thirsty for a crack at the Germans.
The recollection of the barbarities that
had been visited on their comrades killed
and injured in Flanders, their realization that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the Germans had abandoned themselves to absolute
mercilessness and brutality in warfare,
had the opposite effect the German policy of
“terrorism” hoped to achieve&mdash;that is, to break
down the morale of our men. It made our men
all the hotter and eager to meet the enemy and
it nerved men who had an inherent abhorrence
of man-killing not only to go through with the
nasty work, but to go to it furiously. Finally
the call came for the men to file before the
sergeants and get their “tot” of rum and
everyone, of course, knew what this solemn little
ceremony of the trenches meant.</p>

<p>Armed with a revolver, a couple of bombs
and my short-armed bayonet, I led my men
over and we had a front position in the advance.
Ahead of us our big guns poured a
powerful barrage fire. But the enemy was
sending back a tremendous reply. We had
seven hundred yards or more to traverse to get
to Hans and his guns swept us destructively
every step of the way. The knowledge of our
advance got to them quickly enough and the
night fairly went aburst with light in a flood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
star-shells. In their high, ghastly glare I saw
scores in the ranks of our advancing men scattered
and sent reeling by the bursting of the
shells; I saw whole regiments caught by the accuracy
of the German fire and battered frightfully.
But there never was a pause in the advance.
The lines would get together again, the
advance would consolidate anew and we would
“carry on.”</p>

<p>My own little group got along splendidly.
There was but a single tragedy among us. It
was sufficiently terrible, but almost miraculously
it cost the life of only one man. He was a
bomb-bearer. He was carrying a box of the
explosives for use at close range when we actually
came upon the German trenches. A piece
of shrapnel struck the box. There was immediately
a deafening roar which struck through
the grand noise of the battle and the poor fellow
was blown utterly to pieces. Fragments of
his body were whipped into the faces of his comrades.
The whole platoon halted and were
shaken for an instant, but at a yell from me got
their nerves back with admirable promptitude
and threw themselves along in the advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Then our front lines walked into a drive of
rifle-bullets and bombs and we made our first
rush for the Germans. The star-shells suddenly
disappeared. Out of the glare in which
we had been advancing, in an instant we found
ourselves fighting in inky darkness. Hans had
no intention of illuminating his barbed-wire
barriers to aid us in the irksome task of cutting
them down and clearing them away. But our
barrage fire, we were soon to know, had done
some very good work in this direction. Most
of the barbed-wire barricades had been obliterated
by the rush of our heavy shells.</p>

<p>The work of routing the Boche out of that
sky-line trench was very swiftly done. We
gave them bombs a plenty and then smashed
right down into the trench and its traverses
after them with knife and pistol and more
bombs. We cornered group after group of
them in the “bays.” These all whined to us
“Kamerad!” They had better fought. I
knew too much of them after Flanders, the
dirty deceptions they were capable of practicing.
The murderous pretenses of surrender.
My heart was rankling too bitterly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
memory of the ghastly cruelties I had known
them to practice on the men of our commands
who fell into their ruthless, barbarous
hands. If the orders I gave in answer to these
calls are to be regarded as merciless, the dishonorable
Huns have only themselves to blame.
Our answers to their calls of “Kamerad!” were
bombs in their faces.</p>

<p>As I climbed across one of the trench parapets
I nearly fell over a man’s leg. I leaned
down to feel for a supposed enemy, grasped the
leg, seeking to pull the man forward. To my
horror I stood with a severed leg clutched in
my hand.</p>

<p>And a tremulous voice came up, the tone indicating
a mere boy:</p>

<p>“Norfolk, sir,” he said, “I’m terribly
wounded. For God’s sake don’t leave me.”</p>

<p>Three days before the Norfolks had made
an attempt to take this trench and had been
all but entirely wiped out.</p>

<p>I found both the lad’s legs had been carried
off by a shell. But he had torn his shirt to
strips and saved his life by making tourniquets
for his severed limbs. But he had lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
water bottle and his emergency rations, and
had been suffering horribly in his place of concealment
in the parapet. How he had remained
undiscovered there by the Germans for three
days is a marvel, save that, of course, he was
concealed from sight in the parapet and it had
been his good fortune that no German had been
sent to take station in that particular parapet.</p>

<p>It would have been more fortunate for the
poor lad if he had died at once. For after all
his agony, he was to die on the stretcher that
was bearing him back to the field hospital on
our first line.</p>

<p>We did take eight prisoners whom we found
huddled in a bay. But these were wounded men.
They were Bavarians. They told me there had
been great dissatisfaction among them against
the merciless rigors of discipline and cruelty
practiced by their officers, that several times
outbreaks had been imminent, but a stern order
had been posted threatening instant death to
one out of every twenty of them to be picked
indiscriminately for slaughter at the first signs
of revolt.</p>

<p>We had no time to consolidate the trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and its traverses, and hold against a counter
attack for the Germans were back at us with
reinforcements, the worst feature of which was
a preponderance of machine guns. We had
no chance of standing out successfully against
it, so I ordered my men out and into No
Man’s Land. For a while it looked as if they
were going to smash us all the way back to our
own lines. They sent up their star-shells only
fitfully, and as we crawled and stumbled back
into No Man’s Land, I thought for a moment
all was over with us indeed, thought we had
been cut off and surrounded. For out of the
darkness came the rush of scores of men. They
almost carried us off our feet.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” I demanded, but not expecting
anything but a bomb for my trouble.</p>

<p>To my great relief, though, the response
came:</p>

<p>“Anzacs!”</p>

<p>“Oxfords and Bucks!” I yelled back joyfully.
“Who’s commanding?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Foster. For God’s sake, is that
you, Dave Fallon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
“Foster of Sydney!” I cried earnestly. For
Foster had been one of my pupils at the Royal
Military School of New South Wales&mdash;a splendid
young chap and one of my most intimate
friends.</p>

<p>We groped our way to each other in the
darkness and fairly hugged each other.</p>

<p>“Fancy!” said Foster, “meeting in this hell-hole!”</p>

<p>The sweep of fire was growing more intense,
more deadly. A dozen of our men were
dropped. We decided to hold on together.
Had we attempted to dig in against that storm
we would have been wiped out.</p>

<p>We had recourse to a ghastly necessity. We
set our men to piling the dead to make protective
barriers for ourselves. We used our own
men and Germans to make this fortress of
human flesh, building the walls about six bodies
to the width and ten high, throwing layers of
mud between for cementing. It was revolting
business, but it had to be done. The German
fire was ceaseless, the shells forever showering,
the “minnie” bullets cutting straight over our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
heads with a concert of noise that nearly arose
to a scream. Our own artillery roared and
thundered its reply, but we had no way of observing
its results.</p>

<p>Time and again our improvised fortress of
the dead was ripped asunder and we had to
scour No Man’s Land for other bodies with
which to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Of course, in the case of the bodies of our
own men we were careful to remove the identification
discs and all papers to be found.
Foster and I shared the responsibility of taking
these things into keeping, not forgetting to
issue instructions to our N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.’s to be sure to
rescue them were we ourselves struck down.</p>

<p>I hate to remember the awful pulp the German
heavy five-point nines and their field pieces
made of our fortress of dead, the repeated,
shocking necessity of piling up more bodies.</p>

<p>Why the Germans didn’t realize their advantage
and sweep over No Man’s Land and annihilate
us, I don’t know. I’m only too grateful
they apparently didn’t think of it or, thinking of
it, misjudged our strength. I know Foster and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
I expected every minute they would come rushing
out after us. And in this predicament came
a new source of worry. It was now past four
o’clock in the morning. My men had experienced
no sleep for many hours and the work of
keeping up the grisly barricade had driven both
them and the Anzacs to the point of absolute
exhaustion. With every sort of explosion
smashing and crashing around us, danger and
death on every side, yet the men would throw
themselves prone on the ground and drop off
into sleep as if a bullet had brought them the
deeper sleep of death itself. Foster and I
and our N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.’s nearly dropped ourselves at
the exhaustion of the task of keeping them on
their feet. Besides, we had constantly to give
aid to our wounded. My best orderly, Price,
had uttered a cry behind me and I turned to
find him with his right leg blown off. I applied
a tourniquet and Price is now somewhere safe
in Blighty. Twenty of my men were killed
outright during the night. As many Anzacs,
if not more, died.</p>

<p>At intervals in the night I had sent back messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to our lines describing how imperative reinforcements
were, but for hours no reply came
to us and I could not but think that in bullet-and-shrapnel-swept
No Man’s Land every one
of these messengers had fallen. As a matter of
fact, two were killed. But two others made our
base, and one of these came staggering back
to me before dawn, his forehead gashed by
shrapnel, but with cheering words that help was
soon to come. I bandaged the plucky man’s
wound, thanked him warmly for his good service
and then&mdash;my turn came.</p>

<p>Right over us a shell burst. I was whirled
around, thrown, staggered to my feet, only to
be helplessly tossed again to the ground. This
time I got up more slowly, crawled to my
knees and stood swaying when two of my men
gave me quick support.</p>

<p>There was a stinging and burning sensation
in my right shoulder, with every second or two
swift pangs of pain. My coat had been half
ripped off my back. I sat down, leaning
against three dead men, while Foster of the
Anzacs and a sergeant bared my wounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
examined them under electric trench torches.
Partly imbedded in the torn flesh they found a
shoulder buckle of my coat and removed it.
And then and there also they managed to extract
the largest of the pieces of shrapnel that
had struck me&mdash;the nose of an explosive shell
cap and a slug of steel that was found, on subsequent
examination, to be one and a half
inches long and a quarter of an inch in diameter.
This had scraped my shoulder blade and was
protruding from the fleshy portion of the arm.
Afterward five smaller pieces of shrapnel were
to be removed from the wound.</p>

<p>But Foster and the sergeant made a wonderful
job of treating the wound with iodine and
binding it so that within fifteen minutes such
weakness as had seized me passed away, and
although the wound hurt and my arm hung
numb and useless at my side, I could continue
my duties and was able to hang on for many
hours more, able to carry the fight back to the
sky-line trench when reinforcements came and
have the satisfaction of knowing that we
were firmly established there and that an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of considerable strength was on its way
to give battle to the Moquet Farm position. It
was a week later while I was in a hospital
I got news that the Farm was in our hands.</p>

<p>A sharp, overwhelming attack had been delivered
in which a battery of French seventy-fives,
brought up and concealed in a quarry,
aided the infantry with a big band of English
and French aviators as well, who swooped
right down over the Germans, delivering tornados
of machine-gun fire and scared them into
complete flight and to the desertion of some
of their heaviest guns.</p>

<p>But that’s getting somewhat ahead of my
story. At five o’clock that morning reinforcements
came to Foster’s Anzacs and my thinned-out
platoons in the form of the Huntingdon
Cyclists regiment and two companies of engineers.
You may be sure the Huntingdons
weren’t riding their bicycles over No Man’s
Land, but had been impressed as infantry for
this affair. The German fire never let up, but
the engineers blasted temporary trenches for us
in No Man’s Land and the Huntingdons had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
brought with them an extra number of machine
guns. A steadily moving train of bearers
was arriving with sandbags which we were relieved
to substitute for the bodies of our comrades
we had used to shelter us.</p>

<p>Thus with the coming of dawn we faced the
German trench not more than one hundred
yards away on something like even terms. And
soon we were topside in advantage, for our
shells began to find the German dug-outs and
smash down the barbed-wire defenses the enemy
had renewed in the night. By noon we were
back in the German trench from which we had
been driven. And reports from other battalions
all along the line began to tell of similar successes
in the attack. By noon the entire German
position had been taken. There were two
fierce counter attacks and a weak one. Then
with the arrival of further reinforcements
we started in pursuit of Hans and he fled in
panic to the Moquet Farm protection.</p>

<p>I did not want to leave the fight and stuck several
hours after Col. Reynolds, my commandant,
had sent me word that I was to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and that Captain Reed of A Company would
be along to relieve my battered platoons.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock that night, however, my
shoulder wounds became angry with pain and I
was weak and chilled. I received word through
a messenger that Captain Reed was within ten
minutes of arrival. So I dropped exhausted into
the seat of a field ambulance beside its driver,
the body of the car being crowded with more
dangerously wounded men. At Orvilles I
switched to another ambulance and was able
again to sit with the driver. In this I was
whisked to a field hospital located in the captured
“Hohenzollern Redoubt,” now well behind
our foremost lines. There the other pieces
of shrapnel were removed from my shoulder,
the wound thoroughly cleansed and professionally
bandaged.</p>

<p>All this time I never really thought of myself
as being out of the fight and had full intention
to return, but the doctors ordered me to Wimereaux
(a charming seashore resort it had been
in peace days), and I remember meeting a professor
of English in an Egyptian college whom
I had met while we were training for Gallipoli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
who waved to me as I sat beside the ambulance
driver with my arm in fresh white bandages and
a sling. I learned afterward he had arrived
in France only the day before and had been
immediately ordered into action.</p>

<p>“Lucky beggar, you Fallon,” he shouted
laughingly to me, and indicated my arm.
“What wouldn’t I give for that Blighty!”</p>

<p>He was killed in the Moquet action the very
next day and of the five officers of the companies
which relieved mine, four were killed.
I had been indeed a very lucky man.</p>

<p>Via Gazincourt and Bologne I made my way
to Wimereaux, where I was assigned to the
Hotel Splendid, which had been transformed
into a great hospital. For a month I had a
perfect rest, rambling the sea cliffs, reading,
catching up with my correspondence with old
friends, playing with the pretty little French
kiddies in the sands, and staring out on the
restful sea, where, however, as a reminder of
war, there was an island on which Napoleon
in the long ago had constructed a fort and naval
base in his contemplated invasion of England.</p>

<p>My wound gave me little or no trouble, healing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
nicely from the start, and in a month I was
ready to return to service.</p>

<p>While I was at the Splendid, Capt. P.&nbsp;A.
Hall, M.&nbsp;C., sent me the information that I
had been officially recommended to headquarters
for “capturing sky-line trench, consolidating
and holding it during heavy, continuous
shell-fire and rendering first aid to the injured
until hit and relieved.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Spies</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The thoroughness with which Germany in
her plotting to conquer Europe, and later the
world, had infested every country with spies,
the Americas as well as Europe, had organized
a system spreading to the antipodes, has
been written history for some time.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that they managed at the
beginning of the war to honeycomb the armies
of their opponents with these “informants”&mdash;Germany
doesn’t like the designation “spies.”</p>

<p>Well, in the first place, I can attest to the
deftness with which they tapped our telephone
wires between the sectors of battle-fronts. But
I can also attest that while German scientific
ingenuity was sharp and clever, the German
mind was frequently child-like. For we led
them into many traps and serious defeats again
and again by the simple process of sending false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
information over these wires we had learned
had been tapped. The guileless readiness with
which they snapped up this bait was sometimes
almost comical. They were so cock-sure of
their own efficiency in tapping the wires undetected,
that we were able to play with them
again and again&mdash;“play” that frequently meant
death to hundreds and even thousands of their
men.</p>

<p>German thoroughness of preparation, German
patience, German sheep-like concert of action&mdash;these
must be granted. But subsequent
events of the war showed that whenever Joffre,
French, Pétain, Haig, Byng, the Grand Duke
Nicholas ever faced the greatest of the Boche
generals with anything like an arm of equal
military strength, the Boche was beaten. Serbia,
Roumania, Belgium, the child-sized nations of
the world&mdash;these have been the conquests of the
would-be international bully. Noble laurels
surely and properly fit to adorn the low, brutal,
thick-fleshed brow above the pig-eyes of a criminal
empire!</p>

<p>But to get back to spies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The Oxfords and Bucks were enjoying a rest,
encamped near the little, shell-wrecked village
of St. Elois in Belgium. Our most welcome visitor
for several days was a young peasant girl,
decidedly attractive because of raven hair and
very blue eyes. She brought us the Continental
mail, she served us with home newspapers, she
sometimes brought us roast fowl and other
home-like edibles to enhance our soldier food.
She was frequently as well entrusted with our letters
for mailing. She had a smattering of English
which was the first unusual thing I noticed
about her. Peasant girls of the locality can
always make a stagger at French, frequently
enough know a little German. But I had never
met one before who could turn a word in English.</p>

<p>About this time became remarkable the accuracy
with which the Germans were planting
shells along the roads of our Very rest camp,
also how neatly they seemed to be able to time
their shots and how accurately along the roads
which the supply wagons traveled toward the
front lines. If it had been guess-work it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
have been uncanny and none of us for a minute
believed it to be guess-work.</p>

<p>One evening a private of my platoon came to
me with the information that he had happened
upon the girl seated in a small dug-out in one
of our trenches most studiously studying a paper
spread upon the top of the basket in which she
usually brought edibles she sold us in camp.
This private had the good sense to saunter
along as though he had observed nothing. I
warned him to continue to say nothing and went
looking for the girl.</p>

<p>She had still an armful of newspapers to dispose
of and I observed her in her free passage
in our lines, joking with our soldiers, smiling,
affable, and, you would say, the most simple-minded
and innocent of maidens.</p>

<p>She never asked questions, but she would frequently
stand over men at play with cards and
watch the game apparently intently. But, at
other times, if you watched her you would find
her standing near a group of our men who might
be discussing our own immediate affairs&mdash;our
position, what they had learned or guessed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
their commanders’ plans. Every one had a pat
on the cheek and a smile for Marie.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible there could be any
harm in her! I began to think that the private
had seen her poring only over some scrap
of newspaper or periodical she had found, most
probably one that had on it a photograph or
drawing that engaged her attention. He admitted
he didn’t get a good look at it, but
also insisted he was quite sure it was a piece
of writing or pencil drawing.</p>

<p>However, as Americans says, it is “bad business”
to dismiss such matters in war with a
wave of the hand. I decided to follow the girl.
She strolled easily down the road to St. Elois
in the twilight. I held off the road behind her
as much as I could&mdash;wherever the brush would
give me footing. The road was nearly if not
quite deserted at the time. A few peasants’
carts passed. And I noticed that only one of
these peasants apparently knew Marie. They
all nodded to her, but they nod to any stranger
on the road in that country. But one spoke to
her, stopped his horse and they conversed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
a minute or more. The talk began with
smiles and banter, but presently it seemed to
take on a more serious turn. Finally he nodded
his head in very decided confirmation of whatever
he had told her, started his horse and she
resumed her journey to St. Elois. But she no
longer strolled. She moved with a smartness
of step that kept me going briskly in the concealment
of the bushes and trees beside the
road to keep up with her.</p>

<p>Marie halted before a half-smashed house.
The roof was gone and the upper walls, revealing
in stark desolation the empty chambers
of the upper story. But the ground floor
of the house remained intact. Marie loitered
for several minutes before this house before
she entered it. In fact, she waited until darkness
had completely enveloped the place. I
stole up to the house and groped around the
walls. In the rear, a light popped out of a
window.</p>

<p>I wasn’t by any means certain that these
things meant Marie was a spy. For all I
knew she might be a refugee. One found many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
a refugee Belgian family quartered in such battered
places in those days. The fact that some
of the peasant carters had apparently not known
her could also be laid to the same circumstances&mdash;that
of her being a peasant girl who had fled
from a village in German possession.</p>

<p>But simultaneously with the popping up of
the light, I heard a sound that swept from my
mind all such explanations regarding Marie. It
came quite clearly&mdash;the cooing of pigeons.
That, decidedly, I didn’t like. The carrier-pigeon
has played an equal, if not greater, part
with any other method of secret communication.
Not one of the great powers of the war but has
from 100,000 to 125,000 such feathered informants
working between their headquarters and
stations in the enemy lines established by spies.
The wireless, telephones, secret codes, expert
signaling of modern warfare has not supplanted
the carrier-pigeon.</p>

<p>He had proven his usefulness in war long ago&mdash;in
the Franco-Prussian war. It was at the
time when Paris was cut off from the rest of the
world, that fanciers in the French capital went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to the authorities and explained that if the
birds were sent to Tours in balloons they would
return with whatever news was entrusted to
them. Accordingly, more than eight hundred
homing pigeons sailed as captives out over the
fortifications and as certainly returned with information&mdash;so
much and in such detail that Parisians
have since declared that put into book
form would have made at least 500 volumes.</p>

<p>By a process of micro-photography the equivalent
of a sixteen-page newspaper was reproduced
on a film which was inserted in a quill and
fastened to the middle-tail feather of the bird.
These films were thrown on a screen through a
lantern that magnified them, just as moving picture
films are now shown.</p>

<p>Belgium from that date took the training of
these birds and it was from this little country
that most of them were purchased and there
they had been most largely bred at the outbreak
of the war and Belgian trainers have
been busy in the training of them ever since
for the Allies.</p>

<p>Through the lighted window I saw the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
in closest conversation with a man of peasant
type. They were going over a small bundle of
papers on a roughly hewn table with the lamp
between them. There was just the rudest furnishing
for habitation in the room that had
been the kitchen of the house. They were so
interested in the papers that it was obvious the
opportunity was as good as any I could expect
to take them by surprise. So I stole away from
the window and to the back door of the house
which opened directly into this room.</p>

<p>I managed to open the door without alarming
them, but was so intently keeping my eyes on
them as I crept into the room, that I stumbled
over a loose brick in the floor of the shell-shaken
house. Man and girl leaped to their
feet. He lost no time reaching under his blouse
for a pistol. But here I had him clearly at a
disadvantage. My own automatic was already
in my hand. I shot him straight between the
eyes.</p>

<p>The girl shrieked and started toward me in
fury. She had no weapon so I thrust my revolver
into my holster and grappled with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
She fought vixenishly for a few minutes, but
then suddenly relaxed in my arms and began
violently sobbing. After that she very quietly
accompanied me to battalion headquarters.
Once over her fit of fury, she made no pretense
that she had been other than a spy in our
camp. But she said the man had compelled her
to do this work. She was a native of Belgium,
but of mixed Flemish and German parentage.
She said the man was a German, she had known
him to be all the while, but said she loved him
and that it was only her love that had persuaded
her to act as informant for him. Now
that he was dead, she said she did not care
what became of her, what punishment was given
her.</p>

<p>“You can kill me, too. I didn’t like to do
the things I did when the men in your camp
were always so friendly and kind to me,” she
said, “but I would do anything my man asked
me to. He could make me do anything.”</p>

<p>From the dead man’s pockets I secured many
papers, going to show that he had for a long
time had accurate knowledge of the locations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of our railroad crossings and stations, the times
of the movements of our convoys and the paths
they took, the times of relief in our trenches.</p>

<p>The girl led me to a cote camouflaged in the
shattered roof of the house where were more
than a dozen homing pigeons. I took her then
to battalion headquarters. Later at her trial
her life was spared, but she was sentenced to
twenty years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>On several of the transports which brought
the original 20,000 Australians to Egypt for
training were detected more than a dozen
spies. One was caught red-handed tampering
with the boiler of one of the transports.
A ship’s officer came upon him and there was
never a word exchanged between them. The officer
sent five bullets crashing into the spy’s head,
blowing the top of his head off. Two other
spies were suspected, watched, caught and shot.
But several others escaped who tampered with
the machinery of the ships to an extent that
caused great delay and in one instance at least,
necessitated the return of a convoy ship to an
Australian port for repairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
At St. Julien I had also direct knowledge of
the workings and capture of a spy&mdash;a clever one
he was. As at St. Elois the Germans seemed
possessed of a wizard knowledge of our position
and their guns were regularly popping their
shells into places within our lines which we regarded
as most well-concealed.</p>

<p>But from the church tower of the smashed
village behind us, watchful men one night saw
the eccentric whirling and flashing of a mere
pin-point of light. The village was deemed to
have been surely scoured of spies. In fact, most
of the inhabitants had been ordered away from
the place because at that time spies were so
thick, and Belgians and French, supposedly, so
often turned out to be of German antecedents
or even of German birth, that the commanders
had been all but ruthless in sending the people
away.</p>

<p>But none had suspected the padre&mdash;a small,
gentle-voiced little man. I had often seen him
and bowed to him. Good Lord, come to think
of it, I had often commiserated him on the misfortune
of the loss of his entire flock!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
An officer and a dozen men, the instant the
information was reported of the flashing tower
light, were despatched to the church. They met
the good little padre serenely stepping out of its
portal. He was asked if there was any method
of access to the tower. He smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“It is no more than a false tower&mdash;a poor
ornament on a poor church. There was never
a place for a bell in it,” he answered. “Nobody,
gentlemen, could gain access to that tower but
a monkey or,” he laughed in a quiet way, “an
aëroplane and the good English seem to have
driven all the Boche aëroplanes away.”</p>

<p>“But the light flashing in the steeple, padre?”
insisted the British officer.</p>

<p>“There are little colored panes of glass in
the tower,” he answered readily enough, “put
there to be of ornament when the light of sunrise
and sunset should rest upon them. Might
not the flares of your guns have flashed reflections
from the panes?”</p>

<p>The officer considered. He said to me
afterward that he was quite convinced of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the padre’s honesty, but thought that German
spies might have made their way by rope
ladders or some other fashion to the tower.
He declared that it was more by force of
habit than design that he asked the padre to
remain until he and two of his men had investigated
the matter.</p>

<p>They weren’t long in finding out that the
“padre” was a liar. They found a firm spiral
iron stairway leading up into the tower and
within commodious quarters where there were
a heliograph, rockets and flash lamps of various
sizes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the “padre” was telling the soldiers
that he would go down the road a little
way to his modest home and there await the
officer. And the unsuspecting soldiers were
about to accede to the request when the captain
and his men returned from their investigations.</p>

<p>The “padre” suddenly produced a pistol and
it spat its fire twice in the darkness, wounding
one soldier, but before he could fire again the
soldier nearest jabbed him in the throat with
his bayonet. We were to learn afterward that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the real padre of the church had accompanied
his flock in its exodus and though we never
learned anything of our “padre,” it is certain,
of course, he was no priest but an enemy spy.</p>

<p>In the trenches before the battle of Moquet
Farm we got the news of the capture and death
of one of the boldest of spies that ever operated
among us. This man had been for days
familiarly about the trenches in the uniform of
a British artillery officer. His English was as
faultless as his manner affable and his monocle
firm in his eye. I have never learned what led
to his detection, but I witnessed his arrest and
saw him ten minutes later led to execution&mdash;a
brave man, I must confess, able to smile philosophically
in the face of death and wearing his
monocle as debonairly as ever.</p>

<p>I have been asked so often whether in
the excursions that I made from time to
time into the German lines in quest of information,
had I been captured would it have
meant a spy’s death before a firing squad?
So I suppose the public generally does not
understand the difference in classification between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
a scout and a spy. As a scout I went
forward to the German trenches, wearing my
British uniform. If caught, I was entitled
to treatment as a prisoner of war. Were I to
wear a German uniform and suffer capture, then
the assumption of a disguise would bring upon
me a spy’s death. This is according to the
agreements laid down by the Hague convention.
Germany, however, has proven itself
so utterly incapable of “playing cricket” in
the game of civilization and mankind, that I
am heartily glad they never caught me at my
scouting tasks.</p>

<span class="subhead">“<span class="smcap">Woodfighting</span>”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If you should ask me what feature of warfare
was harder and fiercer than going “over
the top” in the lot of an infantryman, there
would be no hesitation about my reply&mdash;“Woodfighting.”
Some of the most deadly
contests of the war have been held in the woodlands
of the battlefields.</p>

<p>And the worst of it was, the British soldier
was all but an absolute novice at the game.
There was lack of suitable training grounds in
England and we had no time for training and
preparation once we got into France. We had
to go right into this dangerous character of
fighting. If I might presume to suggest, I’d
say that one feature of the training of American
troops at home before they go over the
“creek,” should be extensively in the tricks,
devices and tactics of woodfighting, natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
grounds for such training being everywhere
in America readily to hand. I assure you
that the Kaiser and his military advisers
have put their infantry through the most
thorough training in this secret and concealed
method of fighting and America’s soldiers will
find themselves at great disadvantage if they
have not been thoroughly taught the character
of woodfighting, its peculiar perils and its constant
call on the wit and cunning of the individual
fighter.</p>

<p>This last is the chief necessity of this particular
game; it is invariably a duel of wits between
individual fighters. Each unit concerned has to
win its own little fight. It cannot as a rule expect
help from its own troops on its flanks. For
these cannot see to fire at the foe of the especially
beleaguered unit. Besides if they seek to
come to the aid of another unit, they cannot see
because of the trees and shrubbery what they
themselves may be leaving unguarded. Nor
can an attacked force rely on the support and
reserve coming up quickly. It’s slow moving
in the woods.</p>

<div id="ip_202" class="figcenter" style="width: 610px;"><img src="images/i_fp_202.jpg" width="610" height="411" alt="" /><div class="caption">In the supports, waiting to advance</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Besides your aëroplanes cannot inform your
commanders of the size of the force they are
going up against or much of the manner of its
arrangement. The foliage hides this knowledge.
And in no other fighting is it so necessary
for the “little officer,” the commander of a
small unit, to be self-reliant. He is thrown
entirely on his own resources and must win his
own fight unaided. Unceasing caution must be
the watchword. And the soldier in this fashion
of fighting is useless who has not the ability to
fire instantly and accurately on a suddenly appearing
target.</p>

<p>My own first experience at the game was in
the attack on Delville wood at the great battle
of the Somme. I was then a platoon commander
with sixty men under my command. At this
time an artillery fire was not so scientifically
carried out as it was later so marvelously to
be. But our “heavies” were supposed to have
destroyed the wire entanglements and the machine-gun
emplacements to be encountered in
our advance.</p>

<p>When the signal came for the attack on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Delville woods I sent my men out and into it
promptly. But I had already despatched two
scouts to find out, if possible, if the wire entanglements
on the first enemy position had been
smashed by our guns. One of them soon signaled
back that the wires had been untouched
by the artillery fire, but that he and his companion
were at work cutting them down. That
was not a job to be left to only two men, and I
ordered an advance of my platoon in fours.
When we got to the wire it was to find both of
my scouts dead&mdash;one with a bullet straight between
the eyes, the other had been struck in the
heart.</p>

<p>The sight of them fired my men to determined
effort to get past the wire. But we had
to stand an appalling fire as we worked. Five
were killed outright, six put out of the battle by
serious injuries. The fire not only came from
an enemy we could not see behind the trees
but from snipers up in the trees and hidden in
bushes. The wire itself was crowded with bomb
traps. And there came also the drum fire of
machine guns and the hail of shrapnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Then I thought the last hour of all of us was
at hand. For as we now advanced each man
practically for himself, but also aligned about
abreast, the ground gave way under us. An
old German trench had been carefully and most
deceivingly covered by a treacherous intertwining
of branches and foliage with an under layer
of barbed wire, and we were plunged struggling
and kicking into what looked like a hopeless
trap.</p>

<p>The Germans thought surely they had us.
The enemy rushed out from concealment with
bombs and trench knives and rifles. If we had
remained there we would surely have been
slaughtered. I yelled at the top of my voice
encouragement to my men. And they answered
with plucky cries that they would follow me.</p>

<p>How we got out of that trap I don’t know,
but out we came, every man of us, in spite of
the fire that swept us. Our hands and faces
were torn and bleeding from the barbed wire,
our clothing ripped to shreds. But these splendid
men of mine took the fight straight at the
Boches. It was just plain hand-to-hand fighting&mdash;trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
knife clashing against trench knife,
revolvers and rifles blazing directly into one
another’s faces.</p>

<p>My gratitude can never abate toward that
little company of superbly brave men I led in
the Delville woods that day. For time and
again they drew around to protect me. They
recognized that the Boches were seeking to
make a special mark of me. For a long time
British officers had given up the practice of
going into action in uniforms bearing the special
insignia of their rank. The only indication
of that now is on the identification tab that
hangs on an officer’s neck. But, of course, at
such close quarters, the Germans readily observed
that I was in command and their instructions
are always emphatic on that point&mdash;“kill
officers first.”</p>

<p>A big fellow named Morrison&mdash;in spite of
the confusion of the fight I swiftly, sharply
noted the spectacle&mdash;had actually gone wild
with rage. He attacked a huge Boche with tremendous
fury and literally hacked the man to
pieces with his trench-knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
And when his enemy went down, Morrison
turned with a terrible leer on his countenance,
made crimson by spurting blood from a big gash
in his forehead.</p>

<p>“There, sir,” he yelled exultantly, “there’s a
fine piece of German sausage for you!”</p>

<p>The Germans turned tail and we carried on
through the woods, keeping in touch with the
platoons on our right and left by means of
“piles,” that is, men set out at certain intervals
to find out the positions of the people on our
flanks so that we might not be surrounded and
cut off from the main body.</p>

<p>Our artillery in the meantime was sending
out its heavy stuff and shrapnel well ahead of
us, trying to cut off reinforcements of the Germans.</p>

<p>Our objective we knew to be a knoll of considerable
height and length some two hundred
and fifty yards through the woods from the
scene of our first encounter. The Australians
had tried to capture the woods two weeks before
and were rent, torn and sent reeling back
when they had edged their way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
forest to this knoll. For on it the Germans had
built a strong position of sunken concrete houses
thoroughly equipped with field artillery and machine
guns. And their axes had effected a clearing
in the woods surrounding this position. An
attacking contingent was therefore forced into
the open before their guns.</p>

<p>Sent back in defeat, the Australians were
nevertheless able to bring knowledge to the
heavy batteries of the location of this dangerous
hill which was really the commanding
position of the entire Delville woods. So
while we were advancing, the big guns had
been giving the hill the merry devil, but without
destructive effect. Still they had blown
shell craters all about the position and these
craters were to give us the opportunity for
some shelter in our advance in the open and
for the setting up of our machine guns.</p>

<p>The question became, however, after we had
put the first group of Germans on the run, as
to whether there were other forces intermediately
placed to give us opposition in our advance
on the fortified hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
One of our airmen tried to get us the information.
He came down within less than five
hundred feet of the tree tops. The woods were
dense, but he signaled that for as much as he
could see there was nothing in our way. He
had no sooner given the information than a
chunk of shrapnel blasted his engine and the
sorely wounded plane swerved, keeled over and
crashed through the trees and down to our side-lines.
Our aviator was but little hurt, the
trees having broken his fall, and we anxiously
questioned him as to our flank forces for we
could not know whether they were also keeping
up the advance.</p>

<p>There were some two hundred and sixty of
us who finally came out from behind the trees
to make the effort to carry the hill. A great
burst of fire greeted us. But it didn’t stop us.
We went up the knoll, scrambling for a foot-hold,
digging footholds for ourselves with
trench knives and trench tools. Yet the way
was steep and we came reeling down again in
a swish of bullets and great, choking showers
of earth. Six times we tried to take that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
hill. Small reinforcements heartened us in the
last two attempts. It was a splendid struggle
by stout-hearted men.</p>

<p>But at last the orders came for us to move
back and again our heavy batteries began to
smash at the hill in the hope of bringing the
forts to destruction, the enemy into confusion
and to thus give us something like a good
chance at the foe. This attempt went on for
half an hour. While the artillery did some
damage yet when its attack ended the Germans
were still there among the little, sunken concrete
forts on the hill crest with a force of infantry
below in the hollow ground.</p>

<p>We began all over again the bitter, bloody
struggle. Out we advanced from the shelter of
the woods to endure the fiery abomination. And
this time we “got there”! Even now I do not
know just how we gained success where before
we had failed.</p>

<p>There was the enemy still on the slope, still
protected in his concrete forts and with machine
guns and bombs at hand. And the snipers were
working with sickening accuracy from tree tops
and ground concealments, potting us through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
clearances in the foliage especially prepared to
make us their open targets.</p>

<p>But our boys worked their way forward with
a wonderful sort of deliberateness, fighting their
way upward on the knoll in small packs. In
some marvelous fashion enough of us survived&mdash;I
think we must have numbered five to six
hundred in this final successful attack&mdash;to
swarm about the German block-houses, smash
our way inside, strike, kill and finally so terrorize
the Bavarian defenders that they completely
surrendered. In the larger block-houses there
were companies of about forty men. In the
smaller, groups numbering about fifteen. From
these garrisons we took some four hundred
prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners told us that they had deemed
the attacking force a much larger one than it
really was, but they had not dared retreat&mdash;had
stuck and fought so desperately because
they were ordered to defend the position to the
death and feared to retire to the main body because
of the punishment they felt sure would
be meted out to them there.</p>

<p>There were other features of that advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
through Delville woods than the final, ghastly
drive up the armed hill. Deadly perils they
were and which we continued to run into in the
four days following as we grimly, under frightful
shell fire and many counter attacks, held on
to the ridge. Escaping the barbed-wire entanglements,
there were the dangers of hidden pits
dug by the Germans. At the bottom of these
pits were bayonets rooted so that their points
came uppermost and as we marched along we
would go plunging head foremost into these
pits, falling on the points of the bayonets.
Under other camouflage of foliage were concealed
the deadliest mines. Did you step
lightly on them or stub them with your toe,
they would blow you to pieces. Rifles were
cunningly wrought into the barbed-wire entanglements
in a manner to be unseen. Contact
with the wire electrically set the rifles blazing
at you from all angles with almost the certainty
of their bullets killing at least one or two of the
wire-cutters.</p>

<p>It wasn’t to be supposed that the Germans
were going to let us sit peacefully down to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
tea and jam in our hard-won concrete forts. We
had no sooner got the wounded started on their
way to the field hospitals, and sent the surly
four hundred prisoners trudging back to our
main lines under guard, than the first counter
attack was made. We drove it off. They tried
three times again that day, but were smashed
back every time. They kept us hopping all the
time&mdash;nearly every hour for the four days we
held the ridge&mdash;under their shell fire, but their
artillery did not do much more execution to the
position than had our own.</p>

<p>When they couldn’t get us out that way, they
tried gas. This was the worst horror, for many
of our boys in the advance through the woods
had lost their gas helmets. These had been torn
away from their equipment by tall bushes or the
low-hanging branches of trees. It is horrible
enough to see a man struck down by bullet or
shrapnel or bombed to pieces. But the gas victim
is most piteously horrible of all. Only too
many of our boys got this gas and it was harrowing
to see them writhing in agony, their
bodies swelling, their faces turning blue, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
eyes becoming flaming red, bulging from the
sockets, blood gushing from their noses and
mouths. It was even more awful to hear their
stuttered pleadings to their comrades to end
their misery for them with a bullet or knife.</p>

<p>I heard one of my poor men say:</p>

<p>“Bill, put a bullet through me. You can’t
stand and see your pal die like this. For
God’s sake, Bill, buck up and do it!”</p>

<p>We had not found the taking of Delville
wood impossible. But nearly so. We had
strength and determination and by this time
in the war, a bitter hatred against the barbarians
we knew to be guilty of such countless atrocities,
against an enemy who doesn’t know the
meaning of fighting fair. Yet the victory had
been very, very costly in lives&mdash;too terribly
costly. Of my original sixty men I brought
back only fifteen.</p>

<p>The casualties were so numerous as to change
afterward military plans used in efforts to take
a wood. We try now to outflank it, to cut the
wood off from the other lines of communication.
The heavy artillery sweeps the woods, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to destroy the strong emplacements. Then we
go on either flank and try and cut it off that
way.</p>

<p>Since Delville wood and Gonnecourt wood,
which were similar actions and just as murderous
and bloody, it has been calculated
that by direct attack the cost is all too great.
Incidentally in that action I was a very lucky
man. Two bullets went through the skirt of
my tunic and I had four bullet or shrapnel
dents in my helmet. I think, as a matter of
fact, they were all bullet dents from snipers in
the trees.</p>

<p>The handling of men in a wood fight is in
all ways difficult. Men go plunging into unseen
dangers through overzealousness. If the
enemy runs away continue to fire at him, but
do not chase him&mdash;follow him cautiously. The
possible traps are too many for headlong pursuit.</p>

<p>I lost only too many good fighting men that
way. For when they saw the Germans, they
dashed after them, became separated, were
trapped. It is hard to keep men together when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
advancing through a wood. The ideal method
of moving in such environment is a long,
straight line, moving steadily forward and not
in a series of disjointed ripples. When small
hostile bodies are thus met they are easily driven
back. If large bodies are encountered the whole
line halts, keeping up a straight assault. If the
first line is not filled up the part of it that is
engaged will be reinforced by the sections in the
rear of it, closing up with it. If this does not
dislodge the enemy, the units in reserve will be
thrown in at the critical point.</p>

<p>When the company is held up by the enemy,
every man actually engaged must at once dig
something in the way of protection for himself
with his intrenching tools. The support from
the reserves do likewise, so that they may act
as a rallying point if the company is driven back
by a superior counter attack.</p>

<p>However, I would not become technical with
my reader. I would rather recall for him the
deeds of fine courage done during woodfighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Why, I saw a man alone take a strongly emplaced
machine-gun station of the enemy. He
was not so large a man but just full of rage and
full of fight. He killed two men with bullets,
a third with the bayonet, and scared the others
into flight. Then he turned their own gun on
the fleeing Germans and destroyed them to a
man.</p>

<p>The British soldier is heroic in defending his
officers. They are splendidly loyal. Once
when advancing through Delville wood, a German
sniper dropped out a tree just behind me
and would have riven my body with his bayonet,
for I was utterly taken by surprise and had no
chance to turn and defend myself. But one of
my men struck the German on the head with the
butt of his gun, splintering his skull.</p>

<p>I have seen men willingly sacrifice themselves
to save their comrades. One threw himself on
a German bomb that had dropped at my very
feet. He took the full blast of the pieces, saving
not only myself but many other men nearby.
I saw, more than once, brave soldiers rush up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
to a fuming bomb and nip away the fuse within
a second of the time the bomb must otherwise
have exploded.</p>

<p>This lucky life of mine was spared remarkably
on another occasion. As I was rushing toward
the German trenches, a Boche let go a
bomb at me. It hit the stump of a tree. The
stump got the full force of the explosion. With
my revolver I got that particular Boche.</p>

<p>But I tell you there is hardly a day when I
am not thankful for having seen in this war the
heroisms and sacrifices of which my fellow man
is capable. It is splendid to have had an opportunity
to move in the ranks of these aristocrats
of human bravery.</p>

<p>They took us out of the hell-hole in Delville
wood after we had stood the deadly gaff for
four days, sending up a much larger relief force.</p>

<p>The pitiful remnant of my platoon, in common
with the others returning, were in unbroken
spirits. They turned from the tragedy of the
knoll and marched out of the same woods into
which they had forced their way against most
frightful perils, singing, dancing and skylarking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
and we officers let them do as they
pleased.</p>

<p>But I could not feel so happy for I knew
that as soon as I got to my rest billet it would
be my duty to write letters to the parents,
brothers, sisters, relatives or nearest friends of
my all-too-many dead.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Play Side of War</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>There has to be a play side. Human nerves
could not stand the strain of this modern warfare
without some chance to alternate the light
and frivolous with the tragedy of the struggle.
It is not only that all war and no play would
make the soldier a dull boy, but the fact is it
would finish him up in short order. Every general
recognizes this. It is not a matter of
sentiment. It is a matter of business&mdash;the business
of war. Men cannot absolutely be made
into machines and they cannot work well in
the grim business of war if they fall below
a certain point in mental cheerfulness. Yes,
men must be cheerful to fight well. Generals
found that out long ago and they are
acting on this knowledge during every day of
the frightful conflict that is going on in Europe.</p>

<p>They not only take the men out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
trenches after a certain number of hours to
“rest” them, to get them away from the noise
and strain of battle, but also to give them a
chance to laugh, to romp, to exercise all such
diversions as the men’s mentality may specially
select. The chance to get emotional relief as
well as physical relief of which they all stand
in need after the ordeal of imminently facing
death must be afforded them.</p>

<p>In “Restville” good commanders give their
men opportunities of all kinds to ease their
minds and bodies of nervous strain. Dancing,
singing, sheer frolicking is smiled upon by the
officers. Every sort of diversion is encouraged.
Farmer soldiers and gardeners are supplied
with materials with which to plant and tend little
gardens. Other men are given facilities with
which to sew or knit, artistic men are furnished
pencils, paper, charcoal, canvasses and paints.
Others put in their time composing songs and
drilling choruses. In “Restville” there have
also been fashioned beautiful statuettes in wood,
striking models in clay.</p>

<p>Concerts and dramatic entertainments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
common occurrences. There is always a great
deal of fun obtained from the necessity of men
assuming women’s parts in these comedies. The
work of preparing for such entertainment is
often very elaborate. Nothing is too much
trouble that has enough fun in it. And you may
be sure that the audiences at these shows, which
are sometimes held in the wreck of a theater
of a smashed French town or in a barn or again
in a dug-out possibly 100 feet under ground, are
rapturously appreciative. There are always
many recalls. But the actors receive no reverence.
They are yelled at by name and “kidded”
extravagantly.</p>

<p>In “Restville” are foot races, steeple-chases,
catch-the-ring-on-the-bayonet races, dashes with
gas masks, all manner of obstacle races invented
on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>The “catch-the-ring” may be taken as a good
example of the ingenuity in inventing games
having a relation to the war game itself. The
race begins with a dash and ends with a difficulty.
The difficulty is presented by a series of
small rings fixed in posts along the course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Each man in the race reaches for these rings
and must pass the bayonet through them with a
single stab. The winner, of course, is he who
successfully pierces with a single motion the
most rings.</p>

<p>Air men fly over “Restville,” doing some of
their fancy stunts for the amusement of the
men below. Cavalrymen give exhibitions of
hippodrome riding. Dances are encouraged in
the hotels of these “Restvilles.”</p>

<p>But whether in “Restville” or in action, one
cannot help pay a tribute to the cheerfulness
of the British soldier. Tommy sings,
laughs and jokes when marching along the
white dusty road in France even though he be
dead fagged with the heaviness of his equipment.
As the reinforcements move over the
devastated territory and while shells fall all
around him Tommy will sing, “Are we down-hearted?”
“Are we fed up?” The reply will
come: “<em>NO!</em> <em>NO!</em> NO!”</p>

<p>During the suspense of waiting in the
dug-outs and trenches and when the German
heavies are sending forth a continuous hurricane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of high explosives and shrapnel and those
born to die on the battlefield are being blown
to pieces, the others can be heard singing, “I
wouldn’t leave my little wooden hut for you,”
“Mother Machree,” “Home, sweet home,”
“Tipperary,” and “Pack all your troubles in
your old kit bag.”</p>

<p>They&mdash;the men in “Restville”&mdash;talk a great
deal among themselves regarding the wounds
they wouldn’t mind getting. All wounds are
known as “Blighty.” Some would not mind a
nice little “Blighty” in the arm, others express
preference to a “Blighty” in the leg, and others,
more careless, say that any old “Blighty” would
do. They all have a common opinion and that
is that they would rather be blown to pieces
than be blinded, gassed or taken prisoner.</p>

<p>When going over the top in the face of murderous
fire from shells and machine guns one
often hears some cheerful soul shout: “Keep in
step! Left, right, left! I had a good job and I
left!” Or in the crowding as they start away,
you will sometimes hear a man call merrily,
“Keep your distance, Bill, I’m not your little
bit of fluff.” This because of the natural tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of men to huddle under such circumstances.
It is a tendency an officer must combat
since men in mass can be pulverized by
machine-gun fire and bomb and shell explosions.</p>

<p>When a man falls someone is sure to say,
“Poor old boy&mdash;his day’s work is done.”</p>

<p>Or again in passing the wounded, the characteristic
cry is: “Cheer up, I’ll soon be joining
you.” Another kindly call to a wounded comrade
is: “Keep a place for me in the next bed
in hospital.” I’ve heard the Tommies running
through German trenches, throwing bombs to
the tune of, “You made me what I am today,
I hope you’re satisfied.”</p>

<p>I can’t think of how such spirits can ever
be beaten. The morale of the British army can
never be destroyed.</p>

<p>And I desire to say right here that as for
the German he fights like a dog under a master’s
lash. I have never seen a smile or a grin
on a Hun’s face and never heard humorous remarks
from his lips and I have an army school
certificate which asserts that I can understand
German.</p>

<p>Even when the Huns are taken prisoners&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>and
I might remind you we don’t volunteer to
take them&mdash;they bring all their surliness with
them. After some heavy fighting on the Ancre
where we unavoidably captured a few Huns and
sustained many losses, I ordered four Germans
to carry one of my men who had been dangerously
wounded. They refused, saying, “They
would not carry the English dog.” However,
I punched them into obedience.</p>

<p>Once I had as a prisoner a German officer.
One of my men felt sorry for him in his appearance
of complete dejection. He went over
to the man and by way of commiseration offered
him a cigarette. The German officer
growled, leaped to his feet, knocked the cigarette
from the Tommy’s hand and spat in his
face. I never saw a quicker bayonet thrust in
all my life.</p>

<p>As for the play side of war, who can ever forget
the men of the East Surrey Regiment who
on the fourth of July, 1916, went over the top
in the face of blasts of shrapnel, dribbling a
football?</p>

<p>The Huns called those boys “Madmen.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
But our prisoners frequently admitted their admiration
of that particular “stunt.”</p>

<p>It is an everyday occurrence “over there” to
witness a football match on some recently regained,
devastated French field. Often enough
shells from a German battery engaged in its
usual afternoon work of strafing will be falling
within a few hundred feet of the players.</p>

<p>I once acted as referee at a brigade boxing
tournament when during the final bout Boche
airplanes spotted us. They sent down bombs
and darts, but we went on with our sport until
a bomb fell close to the ringside and killed
several spectators. Even then the crowd seemed
bent on remaining to witness the end of the
bout until the brigadier commandant, one of
the spectators, suddenly said: “We are a lot
of damn’ fools to stay here,” and he ordered
the bugler to sound the safety call.</p>

<p>Regimental, brigade and divisional concerts
are daily affairs in “Restville.” Every company
has its singers, dancers and jokers.</p>

<p>It may not strike you as a delicate or charming
phase of trench sport, but in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
months “Cootee-hunting” is the principal diversion.
In other words, flea picking. These
vermin are more terrible than the Germans
in provoking our boys to profanity. Whether
on the march, in the trenches or in billets,
cootee-hunting is played by everybody from
General to private. One trench game is to bet
on who can capture the most cootees in a given
time.</p>

<p>A pack of cards is a precious possession, especially
in the trenches. The best known games
for which they are used are Poker, Banker and
Broker, Brag, Twenty-one, Crown and Anchor
and House.</p>

<p>The playing of these games provides a very
necessary relaxation.</p>

<p>One day’s picture of life in the trenches will
convey an idea of its generality. You would
find men not on duty reading newspapers and
books. They were reading any kind of newspaper
or books. Old yellow fragments of newspapers
were precious possessions. You would
find that they had even memorized the advertisements
and the contents of the women’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
pages. Pieces of printed matter were so precious
that they were read and re-read until each
man could tell you the whole thing without looking
at the paper. Men write letters with tiny
pencil stubs that are guarded zealously and only
loaned to closest friends.</p>

<p>I remember one day when some of the men
were playing Brag. In this game each man is
given three cards and the best hand a man
can hold is three aces. Six men were playing
in this game. After a few unimportant
deals two men got right down to earnest betting.
They staked all their money. And they
staked their next most precious possession&mdash;cigarettes.
Then one man pitted one captured
German officer’s cap against two private German’s
helmets. This was followed by the bet of
the piece of a shell that had been taken from the
wound of one of the players some months back
against an iron cross which the other player had
ripped off a German’s breast in a night raid.
In the end they had heaped up all their souvenirs,
but when they attempted to wager their
next quarter’s pay I interrupted the game. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
was no wonder they had been betting so hard.
The winner held the highest possible hand of
the game&mdash;three aces. But the loser had three
kings.</p>

<p>“House” is without doubt Tommy’s favorite
game. It is really old-fashioned Lotto. It can
be played with crowds which is what makes it
the more interesting and popular. The game
consists of numbered cards with a banker
who holds a bag containing the numbers which
run from one to ninety. As each number is
called out the men with heads down and
eyes on their cards cover their respective
numbers as they are announced, using matches,
bits of paper or stones as their covering pieces.
The man who has his card filled first receives
the whole of the “Kitty” less a small sum
which the banker appropriates as his reward
for supplying the cards and calling the numbers.</p>

<p>“Bankers” start the games by barking in
front of their trenches and there is always lively
competition. The shout with all of them is the
same, “Roll up! Roll up! Come along with
your dough and souvenirs! Come up with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
riches and princely treasures. Come up! Come
up!” and occasionally a very honest one will
add: “And go away skint” (broke). Announcing
the numbers that he draws from the bag
the banker has a language of his own. As, for
instance, the number 1 is called “bottom of the
house,” number 90 “top of the house” and
when you hear the banker shout “clickety click,”
put your covering piece on 66.</p>

<p>It’s just a little sidelight I have given you
here of the optimism and cheerfulness of the
British soldier and my reason for presenting
this phase of his type is to claim for him that
men of such spirit can never be driven to the
despondency which accepts defeat.</p>

<p>Butte de Walincourt! Butte de Walincourt
on the way to Bapaume! What a great
and thrilling story history will have to tell of
Butte de Walincourt&mdash;merely a hill of one hundred
and fifty feet altitude and round as the
crown of a Derby hat! The days and days
when the blood of fighting men streamed down
both sides of that fiercely contested ridge. The
Germans never fought more furiously than
they did to hold Butte de Walincourt. They
protected its flanks and held on to it against
magnificent assaults. But more determined was
the work of the South Africans and the Durham
regiments of England in the battle for the
round top of the Butte. Countless times they
made the summit, countless times they were
driven down again. Great squads of them were
slaughtered, but they would come back the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
sturdily, yes, even fanatically. It was a specific,
concrete test of the endurance and courage of
the Boche against the British and the British
handsomely won.</p>

<p>It was such an awful struggle, such a thrilling
victory that in quick recognition the French
Government has placed around historic Butte
de Walincourt a high wired enclosure wherein
after the war is to be built a superb memorial.
Atop the round mound British commanders
have already reverently erected a stone inscribed
to the heroism of the South Africans
and Durhams.</p>

<p>I had not the privilege of being in on this
great fight, but the Oxfords and Bucks were
brought up to the first line after the capture
of Butte de Walincourt and they certainly
picked out a lively job for us. It was the
taking of a huge quarry behind the ridge. A
dozen times in half as many days thousands of
us poured into this quarry and routed the Germans
only to be literally blown out of it again
by the big German guns.</p>

<p>In the end our army was to sweep forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
reclaiming many miles of wounded France, but
there did not seem to be any prospect of advance
in those days when we were tossed in and
out of that quarry, each time paying heavily
with lives. On the fifth day&mdash;it was in November,
1916&mdash;our battalion, badly battered, was
relieved of this dangerous shuttle-cock existence
and sent back to “Restville”&mdash;this particular
“Restville” being pretty Beauval on the Albert-Amiens
road, some thirty-one kilometres from
Bapaume.</p>

<p>Most gratefully we “packed all our troubles
in our old kit bags” and took our way down the
friendly road. One of the joys of war is meeting
the procession on the way to “Restville.” It
was all in a huge cloud of dust&mdash;marching men,
thundering motor trucks and lorries, the
smoothly gliding motor cars of the officers of
high command and the aviators, lumbering
Paris ’buses. Shouts, yells and laughter, songs,
French and English, and with the marching
Tommies held not at all in check for their countless
antics by their officers. For the officers,
every one, had mighty good reason to be proud
of their Tommies. Officers were constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
giving permission with a smiling nod to their
soldiers to take advantage of invitations from
the motor vehicles to the men on foot to “Get
aboard, you bloomin’ hiker!” And the officers
themselves were being picked up by comrades.
One of the happiest features was the frequent
reunions of intimate friends&mdash;friends who had
been wondering about the fates of one another.</p>

<p>The gloom of war could not annihilate the
wonderful esprit of the good French folks of
Beauval. We were back on a holiday, we were
enjoying a brief respite from grim gaming with
death, and they tried to hide all signs of tragedy
from us. With cabaret performances in the
restaurants, baths, the cool shaves, the luxury of
getting manicured, concerts, vaudeville shows,
public and private dining, dancing, pretty girls,
general cordiality&mdash;why, God bless Beauval!
As, indeed, I can remember none other of these
“Restvilles” of France without finding my heart
prompting the same utterance.</p>

<p>This period of sunshine vanished quickly
enough and November 14th found our battalion
back on the front line at the Butte.</p>

<p>I am afraid there is nothing clairvoyant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
about me. I had no premonition whatsoever
on leaving pleasant Beauval of the momentous
episode so very nearly ahead in my life. I
was all recollection then of the fine time I had
had. I wanted to linger mentally with it as
long as I could. Probably most delicious memory
of all to the trench-worn, trench-soiled man
I had been was that of the hot baths I enjoyed
in Beauval. And the cold showers! I went in
for about four of them the first day in and held
that average pretty nearly every other day of
our rest.</p>

<p>Well, that and all the other pleasant things
were over, and back we were to the dirty, old
trenches, back we were with our old comrades,
the rats and moles, and Old Man Death blinking
at us from the other side of No Man’s
Land.</p>

<p>We got back in the trenches on the afternoon
of November 15th, and we hadn’t been
there but two hours when I received an order
to report at Col. Reynold’s headquarters. It
was a neat little dug-out he had, as spick and
span as the man. The boards walling it were
of spotless cleanliness, the desk at which he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
a model of orderliness, the Colonel himself
calm and pleasant-voiced.</p>

<p>I do not mind admitting that when I left his
quarters I was a very solemn-faced young man.
All pretty memories of Beauval had been wiped
out.</p>

<p>I had a large responsibility and a big peril to
meet.</p>

<p>I reflected that I had come safely through
narrow and dangerous ways; my life had been
spared so many times in surroundings where
it seemed I had no right to hope to survive.</p>

<p>The assignment from my Colonel was, in
brief, that we had lost touch with the 48th
Toronto regiment fighting on our left, that
for the time all communications between us
had mysteriously stopped. He was unaware
whether the 48th had been engaged by the
Germans or not. Indeed, he rather feared
they had&mdash;feared they might have been struck
at by a greatly superior force and possibly annihilated.
The enemy had cut off telephone
communications and what was worse had temporarily
assumed an aërial superiority that had
cleared our planes out of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
The character and size of the German forces
directly before us, the strength of their entrenchment,
machine guns and field batteries
comprised therefore a vital matter of which he
was in almost complete ignorance. As to the
numerical force of the enemy, we had no
thought of waiting to find this out until we were
attacked. It had been the British who conducted
the offensive and meant just then to continue
to do so. But, as an American says, we
surely ought to know “what we were up
against.”</p>

<p>He had given me the task of finding out.</p>

<p>Of course, you realize what that meant. I
must sneak across No Man’s Land in the night,
I must somehow burrow my way into the
enemy’s territory, I must remain there long
enough to get fairly accurate notes and sketches
of the German position and an estimate of his
number and artillery.</p>

<p>You will understand that it did not mean that
I must cover the entire territory and lest I might
bore my reader with the military technicalities
of performing such a task, I will simply add
that to the old soldier certain aspects are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
capable of equally certain deductions as to gun
positions and the rest of it.</p>

<p>It was decided that I would start out at nine
o’clock that night, and though the Germans
were mercilessly strafing us, as though they
were in contemplation of an onslaught of their
battalions upon us, only our long-distance guns
were taking up the challenge. That was a little
courtesy to me. It was enough that I would
have to cross No Man’s Land under enemy fire
without placing on me the risk of losing my life
by the fire of our own guns. Small arms would
have no difficulty in carrying over the strip. No
Man’s Land here was no more than five hundred
yards across. So shells, machine-gun
drums and snipers’ bullets from the Germans
were ignored, our trenches making no answer.</p>

<p>There had been many rains and hardly had
I gone over the top when I realized what lush
traveling was ahead. I soon found myself in
mud up to my knees. A tiny company of three
men, a lance corporal and two privates, followed
out into the corpse-strewn territory.</p>

<p>It looked from the very beginning as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Germans had suspected what was afoot. They
began making an especial display with their star-shells
the very moment after we had started.
When these flares went up, we stood stock still
and held the position steadily. It is when you
move that the light of the star-shells limns your
figure and make you your enemy’s mark.</p>

<p>After the first outburst of star-shells, I ordered
my men to go to their knees and advance
on all fours, thus lowering our visibility. As I
sank to my knees and put out my hands, one of
them touched a man’s face. I drew the hand
back with that instinctive recoil that is uncontrollable
at the touch of cold, dead flesh. I
groped for the poor fellow’s identification disk
and papers, handed them over to the lance corporal,
and then crawled onward.</p>

<p>But soon the sensation of pawing over the
cold faces of the dead became common to all
of us. There was no shock in it any more.
But we were careful to gather up their disks
and papers before moving along. The new
shock came when I rested my hand on the
back of a man lying with his face toward the
German trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
He moved and I grasped him by the neck and
was ready to use my trench knife when he
grunted:</p>

<p>“Who the hell’s that?”</p>

<p>“Who the hell are you?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Warwickshire&mdash;out on reconnaissance. Lost
my way. Nearly walked into the Germans.
Been wandering out two hours. Where am I,
sir?”</p>

<p>I whispered directions as to his way back.</p>

<p>It took us all of four hours, owing to the
caution we had every instant to use, to cross that
swamp of heavy mud mingled with the bodies
of the fallen.</p>

<p>We were soon so near the enemy lines it
would be dangerous to keep my men with me
any longer. I was reluctant enough to leave
them, but finally ordered them into a big
shell-hole shelter where they would be well
hidden from the flaring sky lights. I continued
along toward the German barbed wire which
the intermittent flashes plainly revealed.</p>

<p>I made this advance wriggling on my stomach.
The men accompanying me had evidently
no expectation of seeing me come back. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
wasn’t carrying a canteen full of confidence in
that respect myself. You can’t help feeling
grateful in just such a moment to have had
your lance corporal and two men whisper most
earnestly and sincerely, “Good luck to you, sir,
good luck.”</p>

<p>I fervently wished for that.</p>

<p>Mystery, weirdness and soul-sickening loneliness
for me was in the picture ahead, a picture
you must keep in recollection that I could only
see when it was under the uncanny illumination
of the star-shells. Nature was on my side. The
sky was a vast lowering, starless mist. The
meshes of barbed wire wickedly expressed their
purpose as man-traps, and beyond I could see
the wavering man-deep furrows in the tumbled
earth. And I give you my word, not a sound.
That is, not a sound to indicate the presence of
hundreds of human creatures just beyond me.
No sound of their moving or their breathing.
There was, however, one sound and a dreadful
thing it is to hear. It was the soft scuffle of
the rats among the dead.</p>

<p>But a few minutes later I had reason to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
thankful to those rats. At the cost of a seared
face and torn hands, I was slowly, cautiously
snapping with my wire-cutter a quiet entrance
to the Boche trenches. I had gone far when
I put my clippers on a certain string of wire,
and my hand stiffened, my arm trembled,
tickled and went numb. Simultaneously, came
the sharp, high ringing of a gong. They have
“burglar alarms” attached to the barbed wire
construction in front of German trenches.</p>

<p>My salvation was in the fact that they suspected
an attack, not merely the presence of a
scout. For the front line trenches began spilling
everything in the way of deadliness that they
had&mdash;rifle volleys, machine-gun patter, exploding
bombs, and even shells. Also the Boches
filled the sky with star-shells.</p>

<p>But when these showed no attacking force
ahead, the fire ceased. Still they kept up with
the star-shells. I did not attempt to move. I
believe that my flesh was as cold as that of any
dead man as I lay there in a heavy mesh of
barbed wire. I cannot imagine but that I must
have been plainly in sight to some of the peering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
eyes from the German trench. Yet they
did not see me. I did not dare look up myself
to see what activity of observation took place
among them.</p>

<p>But suddenly the firing ceased and the star-shells
waned. And here’s where my thankfulness
to the rats comes in. I can only think that
the commander of the trench decided that some
burly rat had come into contact with the alarm
wire. I know they sometimes rang false alarms
like that in our trenches, which are similarly
equipped with bells.</p>

<p>When I finally dared move and stare up
through the murk, I saw two sentries posted at
the entering trench. Heads and shoulders only
showed. They stood statuesquely, save now
and then the head of one of them bobbed in
the sudden relaxation of the neck of a sleepy
man.</p>

<p>Evidently after the big flare-up and the quieting
of the alarm, these sentries didn’t think
themselves called upon to be particularly alert.
But I was altogether too close to them to take
any rash chances. I laid in the ooze fully half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
an hour before I dared move again. In that
time the sentries disappeared.</p>

<p>This was good fortune, indeed. Moreover,
I had come to the inner edge of the wire entanglements
and these were only loosely constructed
and I could wriggle my way through if
I worked patiently. Besides, as I had full reason
to believe, these inner wires were not electrically
charged and would not sound an alarm.</p>

<p>Some hundred or more feet from the spot
where I had seen the two sentries I could make
out the spur of the trench, a neatly placed corner
from which a machine-gun could rake an
attacking force. Toward the very end of that
spur I went, still on my stomach. At such a
time as this the likelihood of the spur being
empty of the machine-gun crew was good.</p>

<p>I listened a long time and then risked it. I
dropped into the trench. The mud in it made
my fall soundless. Through this spur I picked
my way to the communicating trench. These
communicators are always purposely blocked off
in a zig-zag manner. They run on the flank
of the trenches that front the enemy&mdash;run from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the front to the rear trenches. To traverse one
of these communicating trenches is, naturally,
to be able to know a great deal of the enemy’s
entire position. Moreover, save for sentries,
and a possible but improbable patrol, the communicator
is not occupied. It is the sunken
roadway of the trenches.</p>

<p>Once inside the trenches, I was less in fear
of my life than when outside. Upon the outside
obviously the greatest watchfulness is exercised.
The idea of an enemy within them is scarcely,
if ever, entertained. I actually wormed my way
past the two sentries I had seen from the outside,
but who had disappeared. They had
stepped down from their parapets and their
heads rested drowsily against the wall of the
trench. Edging past them, I held my breath
and you may be sure, was as nervous as a
witch. They never even moved. But once past
them I moved fast.</p>

<p>The utter blackness of the night was with me&mdash;was
my friend. I no longer sneaked along.
If observed that would most certainly bring
suspicion upon me. In the murk of the trench
they would only regard me as one of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
if I passed in a natural manner as one about his
quite ordinary business. Of course, I was
watchful and sought not to be seen at all. The
zig-zag course of the communicating trenches
helped this purpose along at this time.</p>

<p>I spent two hours in their trenches, unknown
to the Germans. I made a few notes and
sketches, but in the main carried the idea of the
position and its strength in my mind. Once I
got out and into No Man’s Land again, however,
I would elaborate on the sketches. In
case I was killed making my way back and my
comrades found my body, the papers would
prove valuable, my work would be, in any event,
partly done.</p>

<p>And there I was all unsuspected in the quiet,
gloomy trenches, when for some reason or
other, the forces again took alarm. There
came the roaring medley of guns and for me
much worse&mdash;again the skies were splashed
with illumination. I had just rounded a turn
of the zig-zag communicator and came out in
full sight of a German patrol. Two Huns
faced me.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Worst Ordeal</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>I am convinced that these two Germans I
came upon were as greatly surprised as I was.
I do not think I had been observed and they
sent out after me. In that event, indeed, they
would not have traveled together nor directly
along the trench path, but would have stalked
me and tried to meet me, one on either side.
This is a natural plan in such hunts, for when
the pursued turns to meet the attack of one man,
the other has him at his mercy. But these Huns
were together. And we faced one another not
ten feet apart.</p>

<p>It certainly looked bad for me. They were
both huge, robust fellows and just about then
in the glare of the night lights appeared like
devils&mdash;their pale eyes gleaming through
trench grime, their clothing all wrinkled and
bunched about their big bodies, their mouths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
gone open in astonishment and showing tobacco-blackened
teeth. Not that I could have looked
a beauty myself though I have to be thankful
in view of what happened later that I had that
morning given myself a clean shave. This fact
was to save me in all probability from dreadful
infection later.</p>

<p>Well, there must have been fully two seconds’
pause, I think, in which we stood and
faced each other. As I look back on it, it was
a most foolish pause on my part and the same
is to be said for the pause on theirs.</p>

<p>With a gulp in my throat I noticed that both
carried bombs&mdash;and in the very same instant
I wondered why the devil I was standing there
with a bomb in my own hand and not throwing
it.</p>

<p>I let go at them&mdash;seeking to dash the bomb
directly at their feet that there should be no
failure of its instant explosion.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t tell you if that bomb of
mine went off. For in the very lift of my
arm, both Germans swung their arms into the
air and hurled their bombs at me. One bomb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
went over my head. I am quite sure that my
bomb was faulty and did not explode. The
other fell directly at my feet.</p>

<p>I had been too long trained in that game not
to know what I had to do and what I had to
do in a hurry. I pounced on that bomb and
without loss of movement&mdash;without trying to
stand erect and aim it, I shunted the bomb back
at them with an upward toss of both hands.</p>

<p>And then the big thing happened&mdash;a big thing
to me but infinitely bigger to them. For that
toss of the bomb cost them both their lives.
I don’t like to recall what I afterward saw&mdash;when
smashed, bleeding and reeling, I looked
to see what had become of my two enemies.
The truth is they were blown to pieces. One
man’s severed head was nearly at my feet. The
star-shell showed it to me. It was staring up
at me with a frightful grimace. Their bodies
were scattered in that pathway as though they
had been hacked to pieces by an ax&mdash;worse
than that&mdash;as though they had been hacked to
pieces by an ax with a roughened, dull edge.</p>

<p>In the first of the explosion, of course, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
knew nothing of this. I was receiving my own
crippling from the back blast of the German
bomb I had hurled at them. There was a glare
and a sudden shock in my face as though I
had been struck on the mouth with a sledgehammer.
Of course, I went down. But as far
as my own recollection goes I was not knocked
unconscious and I was immediately afterward
sitting up in the pathway while I coughed and
sputtered blood from a mouth in which all the
upper teeth had been cracked or blown out and
the upper jaw itself broken. Then, as the earth
stopped swaying, I knew my right arm was
numb and stared at it. My hand was a red
mangle. At the same time there came a realization
of hellish paroxysms of pain on the left
side of my face and biting savagely at my left
arm. I touched my face with my left hand
and instinctively drew the fingers away in horror.
The flesh of my face was raw.</p>

<p>My long soldier’s training was my salvation
now. I doubt whether without it I should have
known just what to do and have done it with the
promptness and precision of a man used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
obeying military orders. At any rate, once I
realized my condition, once I had looked upon
my red, smashed hand, the slit sleeve and the
flesh all torn beneath it, I immediately reached
with my serviceable hand into the little pocket
in the inside of my jacket for the precious vial
of iodine.</p>

<p>Subconsciously I lifted the bottle with the
idea of pulling the cork out with my teeth&mdash;good,
strong, wholesome teeth they had been&mdash;when
I realized the maimed condition of my
mouth. Then you may believe I hesitated. But
I did not dare risk the loss of any of that fluid.
I must get antiseptic on my wounds. Here I
was on the wrong side of No Man’s Land and
in full knowledge of how much mercy I might
expect from the Germans if I issued a call for
help that would disclose a scout in their territory
and beside that scout the dismembered bodies of
their own dead. Again, if I lost the contents
of this magic vial I must face the ordeal of
dying in agonies of raging, infected wounds&mdash;die
like a wounded rat in the enemy’s country.
It would not do to risk breaking the vial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
against a stone in the hope of transferring most
of its contents to my wounds. There was only
too little of the fluid as it was.</p>

<p>So, red and torn as my mouth was, the upper
jaw broken, I put the cork to my lips determined
to stand whatever shock of pain the effort
must cost me. I did not know it then, but
curiously enough when this wound came to be
examined it was found that although the shock
of the back-blast had broken my upper jaw and
cracked or blown away all the teeth in it, my
lower jaw and teeth were intact. There wasn’t
a tooth injured. I don’t remember exactly, but
this escape of my under jaw in the explosion
indicates that I had probably opened my mouth
to utter some yell or taunt at my enemies as we
fought.</p>

<p>Well, somehow, I got that cork between what
was left of my teeth, closed on it and drew it.
Hurt? I was blind with pain in the process.
My one good hand shook and I all but dropped
the bottle. But then, I was in such a whirl of
pain anyway that the shock of more could not
possibly destroy me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
I could not lift the right arm or move the
hand of which I now observed that the entire
thumb and base of it down to the wrist had
been blown off. But while holding the bottle
of iodine in my good hand, I managed to bare
the entire wound from the torn sleeve and shirt
sleeve that clung to it. I poured the biting
iodine carefully all over the wound. It stung
poignantly, but there had come over me a certain
desperation that seemed to give me unlimited
power to resist pain, made me in an
astonishing degree impervious to it.</p>

<p>The arm was bleeding in gouts and I knew
this had to be stopped and stopped quickly or
it would not take many minutes to make a dead
man of me. Already I was beginning to experience
a daze of weakness. So I had to go
through another agonizing ordeal.</p>

<p>I got out my handkerchief and again employing
my wounded mouth to aid my serviceable
hand, tied the handkerchief around my arm
in the manner of a tourniquet&mdash;a performance
in which I had expert training and practice&mdash;made
a final loop, found a knife in my pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
inserted it into the loop and though my arm
throbbed excruciatingly in appeal for gentleness,
turned the lever relentlessly until I knew
the flow of blood must be greatly checked if
not entirely stopped.</p>

<p>Now you must not think this took me any
great time. I did it shakily but in greatest
haste. For common sense gave its warning that
the explosion of the bomb in territory near their
batteries must soon bring investigators. And
what I knew they did to soldiers they caught in
their man-traps I knew they would as certainly
do to me if I was found&mdash;just cold-bloodedly
and in Hun fashion slay and mutilate me. I
heard the grumblings and sharp mutterings of
men coming up from a dug-out. And when I
say in Hun fashion I mean something horrible&mdash;more
horrible than even the world has yet
learned.</p>

<p>And in that most crucial moment of my life,
I leaped out of the trench and in the same instant
I saw my savior. I hope it is all right to
call a mud-hole a savior. There it was behind
a clump of ragged bushes. I like to reflect now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
that it was one of the shells from our own
guns as they sought out this battery of the
enemy that had made for me this refuge.</p>

<p>I stumbled and plodded for this mud-hole.
Most gratefully I sank into it. I threw myself
into it fully, a dead weight, that I might sink
the deeper into it. I didn’t in the least mind
the pain to my wounds that the fall cost me. I
then began with all the speed I could muster,
slapping the mud all over me as in happier days
at the ocean side, I had buried myself in the
hot, dry sands.</p>

<p>I reveled in this reeking, black muck.
And with good reason. As I sank deeper
and deeper into it and slapped it over my
body, then over my face, when I was submerged
in the black, glutinous, offensive pudding
so that only my nose stuck out, a nose
smeared also to conform to the surface color
of the muck-hole&mdash;well, then and only then I
began to feel that I had a chance for my life.</p>

<p>A mud-hole may be an ignoble thing, but
God’s blessing on this one. It proved, as I have
said, my life-saver. I had hardly thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
concealed myself in the black mess when a
dozen soldiers came treading the path and the
surrounding land&mdash;came wearily, some with
rifles, some with bombs.</p>

<p>I had dared to leave an eye open at the surface
of my hiding place and saw them coming.
But I did not continue this foolishness. Well
enough I realized that just this eye&mdash;its gleam
and movement (even in the night) might attract
notice, especially of men keenly watchful.
I closed that eye&mdash;and with the merest
movement sunk my head deeper into the mud.
I had hoped to keep my nostrils sufficiently
clear of mud to breathe, but in this action they
also clogged up and I must have strangled if
my enemies had delayed long in the vicinity
of my mud-hole.</p>

<p>But they saw the dismembered bodies of their
comrades, and could see no enemy wounded
nearby. They concluded that, escaping our guns,
no enemy would remain long in the territory
and were equally certain he would not continue
his advance toward their batteries. It was natural
for them to judge he had retreated for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
own lines. This, I suppose, is the way their
minds worked and that they continued the pursuit
to No Man’s Land until it became dangerous
to follow it further and abandoned the hunt.</p>

<p>I don’t know. For I did not see them when
they departed. I took no chances on peering
out. I took only one chance and that was to
thrust my nose into the air to keep myself from
strangling, but I did this most cautiously.</p>

<p>I was left secure for the time at least in my
mud-hole.</p>

<p>And I was to exist in this wallow for three
days. I afterward found out that it was
three days. How long I had no idea at the
time. There were hours of torture, hours, I
presume, of coma, hours of delirium in which I
thought I underwent crazy experiences, had
amazing visions, dreamed both horrible and
beautiful dreams. I could not at any time have
been entirely bereft of all my senses for I
clearly retain a memory of these mental fantasies,
none but two very clearly, but the others,
while vague, are still not altogether indefinable.</p>

<p>Some time passed and no bayonet came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
thrusting into my body and no bomb that would
rend me and my muddy blankets into a ghastly
mess, had fallen. The pain suddenly quieted
and a tremendous languor seized me.</p>

<p>Immediately I was possessed of a deadly fear
of falling asleep. I feared in the first place the
peril and horror of the man-eating rat. I feared
as well that I would sink so deeply into the mud-hole
that I would suffocate as I slept. Yet I
realized that it could not be of so very great
depth or I must have long ago gone beneath the
surface as in a quicksand. I remembered the
general aspect of the gap as torn by the shell.
It had been a small shell. The gap was not
large. And was probably shallow. Besides, the
ground beneath me below the mud had a reassuring
firmness.</p>

<p>But had the mud in the hole been of a depth
for me to drown in, it would have made no difference
then. A weariness too intense to permit
consideration of life and death gripped me.
For all I knew it was death itself. What I did
know was that I could not fight it. I simply
passed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
For my eventual survival from the predicament
I now found myself in, I can only give
credit to the good physical condition I was in
when my injuries befell me, the injuries that
were to put me out of the big game for good,
send me to “Blighty” and to get me honors
from King and country reverently to be prized
and which in my greatest imaginings I had not
dreamed of winning. A practical, regular soldier
doesn’t frequently dream of such things.
It is your amateur soldier who is most filled
with such aspirations. Not that he hasn’t a
right to entertain them, coddle them and try
to act on them for they have led many new-made
soldiers into great and brave accomplishments.
I don’t mean such dreams and aspirations
are bad for a man. They are distinctly
good. I only mean that with regulars like
myself soldiering is his cold, hard business and
he isn’t given to enhancing it with romantic
imaginings.</p>

<p>But now I was to take a turn at imaginings
myself&mdash;the wildest! I suppose I fought
again at least a hundred times my duel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the two Germans who grew to giant-size in
some of my dreams and always their countenances
were a thing of horror&mdash;pale eyes
shining through grime, stubbled chins and lips,
cracked lips apart with blackened, fang-like
teeth showing. Sometimes they beat me. They
would have me down and be kneeling on my
chest. And one of them would have a knife
out with which to slash my throat. And I’d
come out of such a horror, writhing and screaming.</p>

<p>Then again I would suffer the keenest tortures
because of the roaring of guns&mdash;imaginary
guns at that, I suppose they were, smashed
at my ears and racked my burning head. I
would find myself screaming at them to desist.</p>

<p>Then I had fine, serene dreams when I traveled
through a great land&mdash;I can’t tell what
land, merely Dreamland&mdash;that was all at peace.</p>

<p>There were no ugly shell marks in it.
There were no frightened, helpless women, no
whimpering children. There was bright sunlight,
huge herds of peaceful cattle, and I
passed (I don’t know how&mdash;in auto, horse-back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
aëroplane or on wings) beautiful, happy old
farm-houses, saw playing children, and the only
time I had war in my mind was when I came
upon a group of old men at the fire of a famous,
ancient inn I knew in Ireland. And what they
were having to say about the big fight was to
marvel that such a great tragedy could ever
have occurred. And I stood beside them and
wept at my memories of the ghastly war.</p>

<p>But the master dream&mdash;one that seemingly
never left me, I have to confess, was of a girl.
Of course, a wonder girl. It seems that this
dream was always hovering in my brain, that
it was always recurring to displace the other
dreams. This girl was of changeless aspect.
She was blue-eyed, always blue-eyed. These
eyes were always blessing me with the assurance
that everything in the end was to come out right.
Her mouth was a marvel of kindliness and tenderness.
I suppose my fevered brain was simply
evolving the ideal girl that had always been
in my mind. At any rate, this girl was my
angel then&mdash;the angel of the mud-hole, if you
will, but she certainly was God-sent to me while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
my mind wandered and my body, without my
will or direction, was putting up its fight for life.</p>

<p>Even in such times as I came into possession
of my senses, she was still only half-veiled from
me. I could close my eyes and bring her vision
back at will.</p>

<p>I had my lucid moments right enough&mdash;startlingly
clear mental periods when I realized
the desperation of my plight, when I despaired
of ever getting out of the wretched black wallow
alive and when I had thought for food.</p>

<p>Here I was not wholly bereft. Of course,
going on such an expedition as had brought me
into my present situation, I had forethought to
carry emergency rations. I had in my pockets
four biscuits and seven cakes of chocolate.</p>

<p>My clothes were soon soaked through and
through with the ooze of mud. The biscuits in
one pocket were as mush, the chocolate cakes
also and the biscuits had, because of the muddy
water, turned the same color as the chocolate
cakes.</p>

<p>I was thankful for the softened condition of
both. My wounded mouth was swollen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
inflamed. I could hardly move my lips. I never
could have broken between my torn gums a bite
off a biscuit. But because they had been thoroughly
wet I could suck at them and draw the
bits of pasty food down and swallow them.
And likewise with the chocolate.</p>

<p>In these clear-headed moments I well enough
knew myself to be the victim of fever and I
was hoping and praying that if it ever left me
I might find myself with strength enough to
crawl out of my black bed of mud and make
at least a fight to get back to my own, to protection,
to the hospital and perhaps&mdash;yes, for
all my wounds, for all the terrors and horrors
I had been through, I did hope I would be able
eventually to get back into the big fight. And
this is not heroics. It is because I am a man
and no man could have seen the crimes of
the Germans I have seen and not want to
fight the Boches as long as he could stand.</p>

<p>Fortunately, thoughts of food had only come
to me in my sane moments and I had therefore
been able rigidly to adhere to my plan to eat
sparingly&mdash;only a portion of a biscuit at a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
only a portion of a chocolate cake. On the
morning of the third day I still had fragments
of each left.</p>

<p>The mud-hole was the only fountain to slake
my thirst for my water bottle had been blown
away with my thumb and other fragments of
my flesh by the bomb. It wasn’t drinking from
a crystal spring. I would press the mud down
and make a small hole that filled with stale
black water that tasted even worse than it
looked. But it was, for all that, delicious to my
fevered, wounded mouth. Drinks of it put more
life in me than ever “trench rum” did.</p>

<p>And I cannot help but believe that my good,
old mud-hole had done more for me than conceal
me from my enemies. I believe it acted
as a poultice for my wounds in the three days
or nearly three days in which I soaked in
it. My fevers had come on at night most violently,
I honestly do not remember ever having
experienced a thorough chill. I was cold and
clammy in my waking hours but never cold to
the point of suffering acutely on that score.</p>

<p>But my food was gone and though my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
was light and my wounded arm hurting me intensely
I found myself on the night of this third
day feeling that possibly I had acquired strength
for the five-hundred yards journey back to our
lines. In my weakened condition, I had to think
of how the obstacles, quite aside from danger
from the Germans, would impede me in the
night. I mean the shell-holes, the sections of
barbed wire left upstanding in No Man’s Land,
and the countless dead bodies I might fall over,
the ravenous rats which might attack me. But
to have attempted to crawl away in the day-time
would have meant certain death.</p>

<p>It may seem a strange statement, but it is
true&mdash;I have the dead men of No Man’s Land
to thank for the fact that I am still living.</p>

<p>There was a mist over the land the night I
made my escape. The mist decided me that
the time had come to “carry on” unless I could
resign myself to rot to death in the mud-hole.</p>

<p>Surely the fog would last until I could stagger
out of immediate German territory and merge
myself into the torn and blasted waste of No
Man’s Land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
I decided to make the try.</p>

<p>The first twenty feet I walked seemed as far
as I was ever going to get. I was breathless,
giddy, and my legs were almost as irresponsible
to direction as was my wounded arm whenever
I tried to raise it. I sat or rather fell into
some smashed shrubbery and rocked and wept
in despair. But that spell of weakness passed
and I got to my feet again.</p>

<p>To my surprise&mdash;you must understand my
long imprisonment in the mud-hole had made
my mind almost as wavery as my legs&mdash;my legs
seemed stronger. Of course, they would. The
confinement in the mud-hole had benumbed
them. My feet began to tingle with an almost
acute pain. But as I continued to move along
I walked the more easily. But I was dazed and
I was continuously falling over obstacles of
brush or loose stones.</p>

<p>With death threatening behind you can perform
marvels and it is my only explanation
of how I ever made the journey I did. I can’t
attempt to tell this journey in detail. It was
a nightmare of pain and horrors, myself more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
like a sleepwalker than anything else as I endured
its hardships.</p>

<p>As I think back on it, it seems to me that I
was always swaying, always stumbling. But I
remember finding myself well out in No Man’s
Land and prone on my back where I had blindly
fallen.</p>

<p>Then the reek of the dead brought me staggering
to my feet and to my senses. I looked
about me like a frightened, bewildered child.
The things I saw were so horrible&mdash;the dead,
sprawled as they were struck down, distorted,
maimed in so many ways, made a spectacle so
awful that I cried out: “Good God! I’m not
going to become one of these. God help me!
I must not. God help me.”</p>

<p>And I went tottering along.</p>

<p>And that is why I have said that if it were not
for the dead I would not be now among the
living. For whenever my strength seemed altogether
spent, whenever I began telling myself
it was no use, that I’d have to give up, my eyes
would turn upon the constant spectacle of the
dead in No Man’s Land, as the bursting lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
in the sky revealed them. Some of them were
headless. Some hung grotesquely on patches of
barbed-wire entanglement that had not been
smashed down by the shells of previous battle,
some&mdash;but detail of this sort is perhaps too
frightful to even simply describe. All I know
is that every time I was ready to surrender,
the sight of these piteous dead men nerved me
to go on. I would not join them. I would not
become as they were. I would not fall and
lie there to fester and rot, to become a noisome
thing.</p>

<p>Positively, unreservedly, it was these men,
who had already given their lives for their countries,
whom I have to thank for the preservation
of my own. Their grim presence drove
me on and on.</p>

<p>Evidently I had escaped from my mud-hole
unobserved by the enemy. No bullets had sung
after me; there had never been a sign of pursuit.</p>

<p>But now I had to consider a new danger.
Weak as I was, feeling that every next step
must be my last, I realized that it would not do
for me to go marching straight for the Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
trenches which I knew to be almost straight
beyond. The 48th Toronto battalion were
there. In such case, I might expect them to do
for me what the Germans had failed to do. I
might expect a clutter of bullets to strike me
down.</p>

<p>They could not know me from a Boche. I
was caked all over with mud. I was a strange
figure. And I well knew that so many had
been the schemes and strategies of the Boche
spies that in all probability the Canadians
would shoot first and inquire regarding me afterward.</p>

<p>I had to rake my confused mind for a recollection
of the lay of the land along the trenches,
for a recollection of the secret paths by which
they might be flanked and then approached. I
never put in a greater effort of will. And finally
I remembered.</p>

<p>After that it was just a long stumble. I was
falling like a clown at almost every step. I
would faint and awaken to find myself flat on
my back or on my face.</p>

<p>But in the end I huddled in a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
pathway so near a Canadian trench that I could
hear some chap singing. It didn’t help me any
that he was singing a hymn and singing it most
lugubriously.</p>

<p>Daylight had come.</p>

<p>My whole thought and effort now were in
gathering sufficient strength to utter a yell loud
enough to carry to that trench. I was panting.
It was agony for me to move my lips. And
weak! Good heavens, I would have fallen over
at the kick of a rabbit!</p>

<p>I breathed hard, tried to fill my lungs and
after a wait of nearly ten minutes, I am sure,
let go my “yell.” It was the most pitiful “yell”
ever made. It was as slight as a sick infant’s
cry. What I had tried to shout was “Oh, Canadians!”
Of course, none heard it. So I waited
there, resting another fifteen minutes. I tried
again to shout. To my surprise my voice came
out strong and loud:</p>

<p>“Oh, Canadians!”</p>

<p>With my last strength I repeated the cry and
it came loudly again: “Oh, Canadians! Oh,
Canadians!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>I tried to answer and couldn’t.</p>

<p>Then a tall fellow with set bayonet ran
down the pathway. He saw my helpless condition
readily enough and strode straight for me.</p>

<p>“British officer,” I was able to whisper.
“Wounded.”</p>

<p>“Cheero, sir,” he answered. “Lots of help
for you here.”</p>

<p>He lifted me, got a long, strong arm under
my shoulders and began leading me along the
little path.</p>

<p>And just then the damned battery of the
Huns, from which I had so laboriously, painfully
and at times helplessly fled, opened up an
intensive fire. Not this battery alone, but scores
all along the line. But I thought only of that
particular battery just then. And no sooner
had I thought of it than a shell burst almost
upon us. We were slammed to the ground.
A burst of light swept the entire position.
My companion’s sturdy support fell from me
and he uttered a scream. I stared toward
him as the dust and smoke cleared away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Simultaneously with the shock or the shell explosion
a sniper’s explosive bullet had struck
him in the left arm. The dum-dum bullet tore
the arm completely from his shoulder. He was
looking dazed but conscious.</p>

<p>“See, I’m hit!” he said in child-like astonishment.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” I whispered at him. “Sorry that
I was the cause.”</p>

<p>He nodded and tried to smile.</p>

<p>“It’s all in the game,” he answered and fell
over.</p>

<p>There came a rush of men out of the trench
to our rescue and they carried us both into its
protection. They pushed a cigarette between
my lips, the first thing that’s always done for a
wounded comrade in the trenches, but I was too
weak and sick to want that small, immediate
comfort. The cigarette hung on my wounded
lips. I tried to thank them, but could say nothing.
I was making a desperate fight to hold on
to consciousness.</p>

</div>

<p>My body was battered, half-frozen, gone altogether
helpless, but I am grateful that my
mind remained faithful to its task. In fact, it
seemed to scorn the state of my body and was
extraordinarily clear and acute. Every fact, impression,
knowledge of any sort that I had obtained
on my venture into the German position
arrayed itself neatly and precisely in my
thoughts. The Canadians wanted to rush me
off immediately on a stretcher, but after the refreshment
of a drink of water, I felt quite able
to complete my work by reporting to the proper
officers the information I had gained. Two
were soon at my side, racing through a communicating
trench from their dug-out.</p>

<p>I indicated to them an inside pocket of my
tunic where were the maps I had made roughly
in the darkness, but which I knew would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
significant to them. My broken and shattered
jaw made talking something of an agony, but
I was able to bear it and mumble what additional
knowledge I had to yield.</p>

<p>These fellow officers were extravagant in
praise of my adventure and almost embarrassed
me by their solicitude, insisting on lifting me
with their own hands into the stretcher that
had been brought and on walking beside it to
the entrance of the hospital which was on the
third trench line. It was no easy task for the
stretcher bearers. To reach this hospital they
had to descend long, rude, tortuous stairways.
The hospital room was one hundred feet underground.
Its only illumination was by candlelight
and you got the impression of mystery and
tragedy. In the dim glow the white-robed doctors
and gray-robed nurses moved noiselessly on
a tanbark-covered floor. Their noiselessness
made all the more distinct sharp moans from
my fellow wounded. There were not cots
enough for all. Some had been laid on pallets
of straw.</p>

<p>Three men were terribly wounded. One had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
both legs off. The chest and shoulders of another
had been torn raw and half his chin
smashed away. My restless eyes saw the face
of another the orderlies were just bandaging.
His eyes had been ripped out.</p>

<p>Some months before I had heard an anecdote
of a poilu who had lost both hands. And
when a sympathetic French woman would have
commiserated him for this dire misfortune, he
unconsciously by old habit and therefore none
the less pitifully raised the stumps to make a
true Gallic gesture with hands that were not
there, and he said to her:</p>

<p>“Madam, it is right that you should pity me.
My friend, Anatole, gave his life. I was but
privileged to give my hands for France.”</p>

<p>I’m Irish and I’m emotional and that splendid
reply stuck hard and fast in my admiration.
It is but natural that a man should feel certain
moments of keen bitterness when he realizes he
has been crippled for life. But if I had the
slightest impulse to self pity, which I had not,
the reply of that poilu would have shamed it
out of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
And if not that, there was the sight of the
three men in this dim, subterranean hospital so
much more terribly wounded than I. I could
only think of myself as having been fortunate.
A doctor had looked at my wounded arm, murmured
something to the orderly, shaken his
head discouragingly. But I remembered that
I had not only escaped thus far with my life
but had the further good fortune of having a
clean, healthy body to fight for me&mdash;for my
life and possibly&mdash;I didn’t go farther than to
think it out that way&mdash;possibly I might not
have to lose my arm.</p>

<p>To add to my optimism I soon began to know
the first experiences of a transposition from hell
to heaven. From the hell of the dirt and
grime, disease, vermin and death of the
trenches to the heaven of the sweet peace and
tenderness that sick men feel under the gentle
ministrations of noble women.</p>

<p>They were wonderfully expert in cutting
away and stripping my mud-soaked and rotted
uniform and other clothing from my body. I
hardly felt a pang when they lifted and snipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
away the cloth from the sleeve of my burned
left arm and cleansed the wound of my long-tortured
and smashed right hand and forearm.
I could almost smile when, having washed my
torn mouth, they further cleansed it with antiseptics
that stung cruelly. With these same
rapid, clever hands they rubbed my body from
head to feet with anti-frost grease and I
grinned as after that they rolled me up in cotton
wool, just as if I were some big, foolish
sort of a doll to be boxed and sold at Christmas.
I continued to grin, for after that they
made a Teddy Bear of me, pulling over the
cotton-wool thick, full length woolen tights and
a big, stuffy woolen Jersey.</p>

<p>One of the nurses was a young woman with
blue eyes&mdash;just the sort of blue eyes I had
thought of when I was lying in fever out in the
mud-hole; the other a middle-aged woman of
serene deportment. The young nurse, catching
me grinning, smiled back at me, but the older
nurse looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“What in the world,” she said in her cool,
even voice, “can that young rascal find to laugh
at in such a time as this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
“Isn’t it splendid,” said the young nurse,
“that he can laugh?” And she nodded toward
me with a knowing smile and&mdash;bless my soul!
what, crazy irresponsibilities our emotions are!
I suddenly found my eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>She came back to me a few seconds later
with a glass of hot milk which I had perforce
to drink through a tube and, thank the Lord,
she made no notice of my wet eyes.</p>

<p>I had been two hours in the underground,
cave-hospital when I was transferred to a
stretcher and sent off, borne by four giant Scots
with two other Scots accompanying to act as
reliefs in the task of carrying me half a mile or
more to another station. They could not have
been more kindly and attentive to gentleness in
carrying me had they been the bearers of
a princeling. It was rough walking, most of it
more than ankle deep in mud, and when one of
the bearers stumbled, went to his knees and
nearly shot me off the stretcher, one of the relief
men strode forward in great anger:</p>

<p>“Make way oot o’ that, Jock,” he commanded,
“and gie me the handle. D’ye no
think the puir officer already hurt enough?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
I would say for him after he took hold that
never once did he stumble.</p>

<p>They finally landed me safely, and with fewer
jars and jolts than were to have been expected,
at a small station where I became a passenger
on a curious ambulance. It was made of a
stretcher swung between two enormous wheels
that one sees on rustic carts. An old fat horse
drew this ambulance. The stretcher swung
gently between the wheels as he stolidly plodded
over rough ground, sometimes muddy, sometimes
rocky. It was slow moving, for night had
come and all along our course shell-craters,
which would capsize the ambulance did it slump
into them, had to be guarded against.</p>

<p>My wounds sometimes set viciously to work
to give me pain, but again would show mercy.
I found a certain soothing effect in the swing
of the hammock. And I stared up at the stars
that were brilliant and thought how wonderful
it was that I was alive at all and reflected
whether if I were to be able to fight no more,
my country might not make use of me in drilling
her other young sons to “carry” on in her
tremendous and noble cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
The good, old fat horse bore me two miles
on my way and brought me to a motor ambulance.
It had three bunks in it and two were
already occupied. When I was placed in this
ambulance I began to think that perhaps I had
been premature in believing my life saved. For
I knew enough of ambulances to know that the
bottom bunk is reserved for the carrying of the
most dangerously wounded and it was into the
bottom bunk they slid me.</p>

<p>I am perfectly willing that Henry Ford
should have such advertising as may be from
me, for it was an ambulance of his make I
rode in, and the fact that it could proceed at
all over the roads we had to travel and often
enough no roads whatsoever&mdash;in and out of
gulleys, shell-holes, over sunken fields up pathless
hills and finally land me at No. 9 Clearing
Station of the Red Cross, certainly earns it
honest commendation.</p>

<p>The ambulance drivers told me that the foul-fighting
Huns had attacked this big frame hospital
only a few days before, and although
their shells had not struck, the shocks from the
explosions had snapped the slender threads by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
which three dangerously wounded men were
clinging to life.</p>

<p>I was no sooner in the hospital than I was
to discover that the Canadians had sent ahead
such glowing accounts of my exploit that in this
hospital I found myself regarded as a hero and
made much of, though you wouldn’t think a
“hero” would create much of a sensation in this
particular place whose every cot had again and
again been occupied by heroes.</p>

<p>One of the first at my bedside was the Rev.
Michael Adler, chaplain of the Jews, and
through his friendly offices I was enabled to
send cards to my friends in England and Australia
and other countries telling them I was
dangerously wounded but most strongly hoped
to pull through. Particular communications
were sent to my old commander, Col. A. Gilbey
and to Maj. Lionel de Rothschild at London.</p>

<p>Again I passed into the hands of deft nurses.
They removed my innumerable wrappings,
cleansed me anew and&mdash;another transposition
from hell to heaven&mdash;laid me in a spotless
white linen-draped bed! I was weak as a
wounded rabbit by this time perhaps, but nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
I was able to get a thrill out of this!
A bed, all white, clean, sweet and neat!</p>

<p>If only a wounded soldier out of the dirty
trenches could turn poet! He could knock the
spots off a lot of things other poets have written
about love and Springtime and a’ that and
a’ that! He could make the song of a thrush
sound like a beaten tin pan by his ode to a little
white cot and the angels that hover round it!</p>

<p>Then three earnest, quick-eyed doctors
looked at my smashed arm. Two of them were
young men, the third middle-aged. It was he
who finally left the group that stepped off from
my bed-side for consultation and said:</p>

<p>“My boy, I’m afraid it will have to come
off&mdash;the hand, perhaps part of the arm.”</p>

<p>I had expected the verdict, yet I would be
dishonest not to admit that I was shocked and
horrified just the same.</p>

<p>My thumbless right hand had been laid bare
of its bandages. I looked at it, maimed as it
was, and shook my head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to lose my hand, doctor,” I
said, “what is left of my hand. Certainly not
my arm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
“Then,” he said, briefly enough, but with
greatest kindness, “I cannot be sure that I can
save your life.”</p>

<p>So I told him that I had always been careful
of my body, had lived cleanly against every
temptation and asked him if that could not be
considered to count for me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “What you tell me certainly
makes a difference. Yet I am hardly willing
to advise you to take the chance.”</p>

<p>A sudden confidence obsessed me.</p>

<p>“I am willing to take the chance,” I told him.
“I know I can fight it through.”</p>

<p>He looked at me in a fatherly, studious fashion
for several seconds.</p>

<p>“Fallon,” he said, in a very ordinary tone
of voice, “I think you will.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t more than an hour after that when
I was on the operating table for the infected
fragments of my thumb had to be cut away and
if the arm was to be saved at all other surgical
work was necessary. As to the success of
these operations it is only necessary to say that
I still have my arm and my hand, though it is
thumbless. For a long time this right arm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
mine was a useless appendage dangling from
my shoulder. But week by week it became more
like a living member of my body.</p>

<p>When I was given an anæsthetic for the
major operation, I suddenly got the absurd
notion of counting&mdash;counting from one to nineteen.
Well, it was “20” before I woke up.</p>

<p>When I did so it was to find myself squeezing
for dear life the hand of the nurse beside me.
As I batted my eyes she said:</p>

<p>“You bad boy, you’re hurting me.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was in heaven holding the hand
of an angel!” I gasped at her, not making much
of a success, however, of this attempt to be gay.</p>

<p>But she chuckled&mdash;the nicest softest chuckle
you ever heard.</p>

<p>“That,” she told me, “will be sufficient of
your blarney.”</p>

<p>Then I had a long sleep. And when I awakened
I was weak as an infant and for days fed
like one&mdash;hot milk out of a bottle from a baby’s
tube affixed.</p>

<p>They told me afterward the fight for my
life was a hard one&mdash;on one or two occasions
desperate. I know myself there were times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
when I thought the fight was going to finish
against me.</p>

<p>But something happened that would brace
any man. The nurse with the lovely chuckle
brought a paper to me and read it, pausing to
make every word clear, distinct, impressive. I
could feel new blood racing into my veins at
every word.</p>

<p>For she read to me the order of recommendation
for the decoration of Lieut. David Fallon
with the Military Cross as sent out from
my Battalion Headquarters, forwarded to Field
Marshal Haig at Grand Headquarters, approved
by the great British leader, and thence
forwarded for posting in all British commands.</p>

<p>And it read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lieut. David Fallon, Oxfordshire and
Buckshire Light Infantry. Though dangerously
wounded he carried out a most daring
reconnaisance and gained much valuable information.
He set a splendid example throughout.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t think science would have failed me.
But if it were going to, here was the magic cure.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Honored by the King</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>There would be little gratitude in me if I
did not set down in this story of my experiences
the delightful kindnesses and unremitting
attentions which came to me after, on the score
of a fighting man, I had become useless to my
country. For the country certainly wasn’t ungrateful.
Famous surgeons were giving attention
constantly to the thorough healing and
saving of my arm, there followed constant
treatments to destroy the paralysis which
afflicted it, treatments which promise in time I
shall have the use of it restored.</p>

<p>And quite as remarkable was the repair of
my broken jaw, the extraordinary skill of dentistry
by which the broken teeth were re-made,
the jaw itself braced and placed firm by golden
bands. When the work was completed I was
overjoyed to find that I could articulate without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the slightest impediment and masticate as
thoroughly and easily as ever I could. For a
long time, however, I was restricted to mere
liquid food, feeding out of a tube as if David
Fallon were thirty weeks instead of thirty years
old.</p>

<p>From the hospital where the operation on
my arm had been performed I was taken in
company with scores of other injured in a
battalion of motor cars to a train at Albert
whence we traveled to Rouen, where I remained
for several weeks at No. 8 General Hospital
and where my attending physician was Capt.
Page, and my nurse, Miss Templey, a cousin
of Maj. Templey, all of whom I had known in
India.</p>

<p>I was quickly recovering my strength and was
finally sent aboard the <i>Caledonia</i> for the trip
to Southampton. They had spotless, clean
bunks for us and scores of charming young
women&mdash;young college women, who had left
their studies to serve in the Volunteer Aid Detachment.
Imagine the peace and pleasure for
men who were just returning from hell to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
such companionship, to listen to songs beautiful
and soft, where they had been listening to the
scream of shells, to hear voices sweet and
gentle where they had been for months hearing
only the sharp moans of the wounded or
the raucous voices of authority raised in deadly
emergencies! Talk of Nirvana at its best!
This was something better!</p>

<p>Arrangements for our reception at Southampton
were as smoothly efficient and kindly as
had been our transportation and treatment in
France. Individually, good fortune was attending
every little distance in my journey. Taken
to London I found myself billeted in the home
of Lady Carnarvon in Bryanston Square. She
had turned her beautiful residence into a hospital
and there I was quartered in a spacious
apartment with Lieutenant McDonald of a
Lancashire regiment who had a smashed leg
and Capt. Fred Monk, M.&nbsp;C., who had also a
smashed leg and lost an arm.</p>

<p>But he was very cheerful regarding the situation
and so was McDonald. On the train for
the wounded and also aboard the <i>Caledonia</i> you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
hardly heard any talk of war. Everybody was
sick of it. They wanted to talk about anything
but war. But here at Lady Carnarvon’s in the
days that followed, naturally our memories
came crowding back. And we went over our
hardships, the thrills we had experienced and
then inevitably the panorama would sweep our
vision of the sections of No Man’s Land we
had seen with its piled and distorted dead and
one of us without feeling the necessity of telling
the others of what he was thinking would as
inevitably say:</p>

<p>“Well, we are very lucky beggars after all.”</p>

<p>These would usually be the thoughts in the
twilight hour and then in would walk our smiling
rosy-cheeked Irish tease of a nurse, Miss
Anne O’Laughlin&mdash;all the nurses at Lady Carnarvon’s
were Irish and therefore for me the
more charming&mdash;preceding an orderly with tea
things. She’d sit and smile and jest and make
an hour or more dash by so pleasantly that&mdash;well,
we very well knew at those times that we
were very lucky beggars indeed.</p>

<p>Then when I was on my feet, I was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Lady Furness’ hospital at Harrowgate and
there I spent a delightful convalescence and
there it was that I received the despatch from
the Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty to appear
at Buckingham Palace for decoration.</p>

<p>Col. Holland, D. S. O., of the Indian Army,
commandant at Lady Furness’ hospital, personally
brought me the despatch and seemed as
proud of it as I was, for I had been one of his
youngsters in the ranks in India.</p>

<div id="ip_291" class="figcenter" style="width: 603px;"><img src="images/i_fp_290.jpg" width="603" height="397" alt="" /><div class="caption">To appear before the King</div></div>

<p>The despatch read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your attendance is required at Buckingham
Palace on Wednesday the twenty-fifth inst. at
ten-thirty o’clock a.m. Service dress Regret
that no one except those to be invested can be
admitted to the Palace Please telegraph acknowledgment</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">The Lord Chamberlain</span>, London
</p></blockquote>

<p>I went to London as the guest of some old
friends named Morris, and accompanied by
Miss Dora Morris, daughter of the family, and
Miss Norah Dixon of Australia, motored to
Buckingham Palace, arriving under the arch at
one of the entrances and then not being certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
as to which of the roadways of approach to
Buckingham I should take.</p>

<p>I had the problem solved for me by a
“bobby” who, with an agonized expression, ran
toward our car, frantically waving his white
gloves.</p>

<p>“Out of the way quickly, sir!” he shouted.</p>

<p>I was pardonably nettled.</p>

<p>“But I have been commanded here to receive
the Military Cross.”</p>

<p>He saluted, but shouted to the chauffeur:</p>

<p>“To the left&mdash;to the left. Good Lor’, the
King’s behind you!”</p>

<p>Of course, the chauffeur responded with alacrity
and as his Majesty went by, flanked by
an Admiral and a General of his command, I
saluted and the salute was returned by all three.</p>

<p>Then the “bobby,” still flustered, directed my
car along the right road and a few minutes
later the young ladies left me at the entrance
to Buckingham. No arrangements for spectators
are made for these ceremonies, none invited.</p>

<p>I was relieved of my hat and stick by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
august-looking footman, who whispered to me
to retain my gloves, and I passed into a large
reception-room where there were already some
two hundred soldiers, officers and men of the
ranks, summoned for a like purpose as myself
and within the next minute nearly one hundred
more. The furnishings of the salon were Victorian,
the upholstering well-worn. Big paintings
were on the walls, illustrating most of the
picturesque events in the life of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Among those assembled were six men who
had achieved the rare distinction of the Victoria
Cross, more than a hundred who had earned
the Distinguished Service Order and the remainder
M.&nbsp;C.’s. The majority of us showed
on our bodies the marks of the experiences we
had been through. There were more than a
score who had been blinded, more than half a
hundred who had to use crutches. Nearly
every face was scarred.</p>

<p>The V. C.’s and D. S. O.’s were directed to
the right side of the room and we to the left
and then the Lord Chamberlain called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
“Order, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>When we had come to attention he said:</p>

<p>“This is the order of procedure you will observe.
Names will be called with regard to
seniority and alphabetically. You will walk
in file as your names are called and you will
then proceed under the escort of chamberlains
until you come to the door of the room where
his Majesty is presenting the honors. You will
keep the left hand gloved and bare the right.
As you enter his Majesty’s presence you will
turn to the left and be facing the King. As
your turn comes, I will read out from the Gazette
the reason for which honor is to be conferred
on you. Then you will advance two
steps and bow. When your medal has been
placed upon you by his Majesty who will, of
course, shake hands and speak to you, you will
step two paces to the rear, bow, turn to the
right and leave by the right exit.”</p>

<p>As the names were being called attendants
passed among us, affixing to the left on the
breast of our tunics golden pins on which later
his Majesty would hang the medals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
When my turn came and I had observed the
instructions and stood before the King it was
to face a small, slightly stooped gentleman
of quiet, kindly-eyed, friendly demeanor and
most unassuming despite the rather gorgeous
general’s uniform he wore. An admiral stood
at his left; a general at his right. Each had in
his possession the medals to be awarded the
men of his particular branch of the Imperial
service.</p>

<p>My right arm was still perforce in a sling.
The King, quickly noting it, extended his left
hand to me and with my left hand I clasped it.</p>

<p>“You are to regain the use of your arm, I
hope,” he said.</p>

<p>“The doctors are not sure, your Majesty,”
I answered, “but I am optimistic.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you will,” he said, and glancing at
the scar on my left cheek, asked me if my eyes
had been affected. His voice was genuinely
sympathetic; he appeared really interested.</p>

<p>I told him in this regard I had been most fortunate&mdash;my
sight was not in any serious degree
affected.</p>

“I am happy to hear it. And how have you
been treated in your illness? Are there any
complaints that should be made in regard to
arrangements for the wounded and their treatment?”</p>

<p>“I have only the greatest praise from beginning
to end, your Majesty,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said, and then as my Military
Cross was handed him, he affixed it to my tunic
and said:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Fallon, we deeply thank you for
your services and I hope you live many years
to wear the decoration I have placed upon
you.”</p>

<p>With that I stepped back the directed two
paces, bowed and left by the right door, returned
to the salon, received my hat and stick
and stepped out to the entrance where the motor
car, that had been parked on the grounds, was
summoned and I started back to the home of
my friends. My young lady companions had
graciously awaited me in the car.</p>

<p>Yet I rode back not altogether happily. I
had come through with my life, I was maimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
but by no means crippled for future usefulness,
my nerves and mind were unimpaired, I had the
King’s decoration on my coat, but for all that
I felt an actual keen pang of lonesomeness. I
was out of it&mdash;out of the big fight.</p>

<p>I will close this book with words far
nobler and more graceful than any I could pen
which speak for the spirit which has brought to
England, from East and South and North and
West the hundreds of thousands, the millions
who have taken up arms for her in this great
trial of her future life, her prestige and her
honor and for the humanity, democracy and
civilization which history grants she has always
championed.</p>

<p>I got it from an Anzac private crippled for
life, as he lay on a hospital cot in London, and
he told me he had it from his father, a veteran
of the Boer War, who had treasured it from
that time. It was a clipping from the London
Spectator, deeply yellowed in the passing of
nearly a score of years. And it reads:</p>

<p>The most notable novel that has been
published during the past year is “SALT
OF THE EARTH” by Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick.
For months it has consistently
headed the lists of best selling novels and
deservedly so, for nothing has been written
that shows the soul of Germany as this remarkable
book does.</p>

<p>“We are the Salt of the Earth. God has
chosen us to regenerate the world. We are
the apostles of Progress,” said the Kaiser
in his famous speech at Potsdam. Mrs.
Sidgwick has spent most of her life among
these “supermen”&mdash;studying, observing, assimilating.
She is the most competent person
to write this type of novel and that she
has done her work well is best proven by the
success of her book.</p>

<p>Here are a few specimen pages. “SALT
OF THE EARTH” is for sale wherever
books are sold.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">All</span> through the night it had been touch and
go with Brenda. She had undressed and gone
to bed, but not to sleep. She had got up, half
dressed again, and sat at her open window staring at
the silent summer darkness of the garden. Suppose
she did it! Suppose she stole out of the house with
the few pounds she possessed and sent a telegram to
her mother or left a note assuring her that she was
alive and well, but could not marry Lothar. It had
been done before, and still the world went round.
But she would have to walk up and down London all
night, and probably be molested or taken up by the
police; and the police were so stupid and yet so
knowing that they would probably find out who she
was and bring her back in time for the civil wedding
which was to take place at the nearest Registrar’s
office at eleven. There was no hurry. If she decided
to go, six o’clock would be time enough, just before
the servants were up. The quiet coat and skirt she
meant to put on for the morning lay ready for her.
Her wedding gown was in a wardrobe with her veil
and wreath of orange blossom. She was wearing no
myrtle. She knew that German brides invariably
wore myrtle, but she was English and wished to
remain English. She had taken her country for
granted till now, when she was going to leave it for
ever. All the liberty and sweetness of life here she
had taken as a matter of course, and even joined in
the laughter against England that seems amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1122" id="Page_1122">1122</a></span>
while you live there enjoying all it gives. She had
thought it would be a pleasant adventure to set up
house in a foreign land and taste its strangeness; but
she had not thought enough of the way back, a way
closed by marriage. She could never come back
except as a visitor and by permission of Lothar. He
had promised her that she could come back every
year for some weeks, and unless she stole out of the
house now at the eleventh hour she would have to
depend on his promise. Altogether she would be
dependent on him, it seemed&mdash;dependent on his
pleasure and displeasure, on his opinions, on his family.
Her own family would be a long way off henceforward.
She lay down, half dressed, outside her bed,
weary, dispirited and in doubt. So her mother found
her, fast asleep, next morning. She had slept through
the hour when she might have escaped, slept fast and
dreamlessly as she had not done for a week.</p>

<p>“It is ten o’clock,” said Mrs. Müller. “I would
not allow them to wake you. But now you’ve only
just time to dress.”</p>

<p>“I meant to wake at six,” said Brenda, still dazed
with sleep.</p>

<p>“What for?” said Mrs. Müller, whose hands were
full of letters, telegrams and parcels. Her question
remained unanswered, but she did not notice it because
a maid came in with a breakfast tray and because
there were various things to look at and discuss. She
was not quite happy about her daughter’s marriage,
but it never even occurred to her that anything could
stop it now.</p>

<p>Anyhow, nothing did stop it. At three o’clock
Brenda came out of church married, for better for
worse, to Lothar, and at five o’clock she departed with
him in her father’s car. They were going to Dover
that night and to Paris to-morrow. The wedding had
been a crowded one and well arranged. Eight bridesmaids
and two pages had followed Brenda to the altar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1123" id="Page_1123">1123</a></span>
a full choral service had accompanied her marriage
vows, her friends had given her an affectionate send
off, and as she took a last look at her old home she saw
her own people in the foreground, her father and
mother, Jem, Violet and Thekla, and Thekla’s two
little girls, Mary and Barbara.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott sei Dank</i>, that’s over,” said Lothar. “Take
off your veil, little wife. It is impossible to kiss a
woman properly through a veil.”</p>

<p>“People can see in,” said Brenda doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What do I care?” cried Lothar, and strained her
fiercely to him.</p>

<p>That sort of thing went on all through the honeymoon,
and Brenda found it wearing. If Lothar wanted
a veil off he said so without any consideration for her,
and if he wanted to put his arm round her he did not
mind who looked on. In fact, he walked her up and
down the terrace of a Swiss hotel so interlaced that
she knew every one English must be laughing at
them; but she submitted rather than to risk an explosion
of temper. He had no control over his temper, she
soon found; and quite childish trifles roused it. Wherever
they went, sound and fury went with them, so
that she dreaded a meal because it usually meant a
row with a waiter. She could see that every one
who served him hated him, and she knew that his
arrogance was never served as well as, for instance,
her father’s considerate politeness. His behavior
to her was uxorious and tyrannical, a blend that
could not please a girl as detached and fastidious as
Brenda. If she had been blindly in love with him,
she might have borne to be adored, scolded, kissed,
bullied, checked here and ordered there in a whirlwind
of proprietary ardor. But she never had been blindly
in love, and marriage did not make her so. There
must be something wanting in one of them, she
thought, some magnetic quality in him that would
have fascinated her, or some strain of the elemental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1124" id="Page_1124">1124</a></span>
woman in her that would have surrendered to a mate
with a club. When it was time to go to Berlin she
felt relieved. He would be hard at work at once, he
told her, and she would have many lonely hours. She
looked forward to them.</p>

<p>About their arrival in Berlin he preserved a resolute
silence that vexed her. He would not tell her whether
they were to stay with his parents or in a hotel or in
rooms till their home was ready for them, nor would
he say in what quarter he thought of living or whether
they were to have a flat or what he called a villa.
When she questioned him about these matters he
evaded her and enlarged on the perfect taste and
judgment exercised by Little Mamma and his sisters
in domestic matters. He said again and again that
though Elsa’s husband was rich and Mina’s comparatively
poor, they were both so blessed in their wives
that their existence was one of unbroken comfort.
In fact, they were men any man must envy.</p>

<p>“If you model yourself on my sisters in all ways,
you will make me happy,” he said.</p>

<p>“When you talk like that you remind me that I
want to be happy myself,” said Brenda, who was
finding unsuspected and disturbing wells of anger in
herself at times.</p>

<p>“A woman’s happiness lies in self-sacrifice and
devotion to others. At least with us it does. Our
ideas ...”</p>

<p>“Your ideas about women are out of date,” said
Brenda. “You will find them all in our older poets.”</p>

<p>“You talk nonsense, my little treasure, and if you
did not look so pretty in that white <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">peignoir</i> you would
make me angry. My ideas about women are the
right ones. At any rate they will govern your conduct
in future. We have women in Berlin with what you
call advanced opinions, but no one pays the least
attention to them. We do not even allow a woman
to attend a political meeting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1125" id="Page_1125">1125</a></span>
“You allow her to do heavy field work. I have
seen it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? A woman is there to serve men and
rear children. Otherwise the world could get on
better without her. What does she do for the world?
She has no economic existence at all, and she cannot
bear arms. All she can do is to devote herself to
others. My mamma and my sisters are busy from
morning till night and never think of themselves at
all.”</p>

<p>Brenda naturally wondered whether Lothar’s sisters
were going to be as tiresome and officious as his
mother, and she made up her mind that she would try
to live as far from them as possible. With this idea in
her mind, one wet afternoon she unfolded a map of
Berlin that she had with her and began finding the
Bavarian quarter where she knew that the Erdmanns
lived.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” said her husband when
he came in and found her employed in this way.
“A map of Berlin! Where did you get it? In
London? Have they maps of Berlin in London?
Do you understand how to use a map? You see this
long street, the Kurfürstendamm! That is where
we shall live. You have nothing to compare with it
in London.”</p>

<p>“I should like to live right in the forest, outside
the city,” said Brenda.</p>

<p>“We shall live in the Kurfürstendamm,” said
Lothar and would say no more. It was not till they
actually arrived in Berlin a week later, and were
received at the station by a family group with offerings
of flowers, that Brenda learned what hung over her.
The group consisted of Little Mamma, Elsa, Mina,
Professor August Zorn and some children. Brenda,
alighting in a limp, weary condition, got a confused
impression of gushing embraces, critical glances,
flowers, pigtails and a harsh croaking voice that laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">1126</a></span>
down the law even to Little Mamma. When the
group moved on, some of it got into a taxi and some
said they would go back, as they came, by tramcar.
Brenda found herself in a large taxi with Little
Mamma, Lothar and Professor Zorn. She wondered
why he came in the taxi and let his wife and children
go by car; and she decided at a glance that she did not
like him. She had never seen such a plain little pompous
irritable man. He had fat cheeks the color
of tallow, a button nose, beady black eyes, and a quick,
fidgety manner. As he got into the taxi he stumbled
over Brenda’s dressing bag, and that upset his temper
sadly.</p>

<p>“The bag is much too big,” he said. “My wife
has a small bag which she can carry. It holds my
things as well as hers. I hate impediments on a
journey.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott sei Dank</i>, our travels are over,” said Lothar.
“When one marries one has to have a wedding
journey, but ours has lasted too long. I’m sick of
hotels.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” said Brenda, who though
it was time to know.</p>

<p>“Where does a young wife expect to go?” snapped
August. “What a strange question! To your husband’s
home, of course.”</p>

<p>“But we have not chosen our home yet,” said
Brenda.</p>

<p>“It has been chosen for you,” said Frau Erdmann
solemnly. “You will find everything ready, even to
the roast in the oven and the cook to dish it up. It
has been hard work, but every day when I returned
with an aching head and agitated nerves I said to
Wilhelm, ‘I do it for my son and he will thank me.’”</p>

<p>“Little Mamma, I thank you from the bottom of
my heart,” exclaimed Lothar, and printed a resounding
kiss somewhere near one of the sandy wings that
nearly covered his mother’s ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1127" id="Page_1127">1127</a></span>
“Do you mean that you have taken a flat and put
my furniture into it?” said Brenda.</p>

<p>“‘My’ is a word never heard on the lips of a
German wife,” said the Professor. “You and all
you bring with you are now the property of Lothar.”</p>

<p>Brenda had not known many violent dislikes in
her life, but she conceived one now for the Professor,
and as she thought he was behaving offensively
she ignored him and, turning to her mother-in-law,
asked again whether a flat had really been taken for
them. But before Frau Erdmann could reply August
bounced to his feet, livid with fury, and shouted to the
driver to stop.</p>

<p>“What is it, August?” said Frau Erdmann. “Are
you not well?”</p>

<p>The little man was actually spluttering with rage
as he answered.</p>

<p>“I am evidently not good enough for the gracious
one. When I speak she does not answer. This is
English Kultur. When a man of years and learning
addresses such a silly goose, she replies with a stare
and does not know enough to open her mouth. But
there is a limit to what my dignity can endure.
Civility is my right and I insist on it. If Lothar is
under the slipper, it is not my affair. Such manners
are typical.”</p>

<p>Brenda was aghast and looked at Lothar. She saw
no promise of support in his face, but only scowling
impatience; while Frau Erdmann, after waiting for
him to speak, said: “I should have thought you
would expect Brenda to be polite to your relatives.
My idea of good manners is to reply amiably when I
am addressed. August was quite right. It is unbecoming
in a young wife to speak as if anything in the
house belonged to her only.”</p>

<p>“It was quite accidental and shall never happen
again,” said Brenda, and then the taxi stopped at a
tall house liberally decorated with turrets and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1128" id="Page_1128">1128</a></span>
on either side of the front door two colossal figures
made of red brick. A lift took the perturbed party
to the fourth floor, where on one of the doors Brenda
saw a brass plate with her husband’s name. A
blowsy-looking maidservant wearing a tartan skirt,
a velveteen bodice, and a coral brooch appeared in
answer to the bell, bid them good day and invited
them in. She looked hard at Brenda, addressed Frau
Erdmann as <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">gnädige Frau</i>, and said that she was
all in a flutter because the meat had only just come
and would not be ready as early as it should have
been.</p>

<p>“Welcome, little wife, to our home,” said Lothar
as they entered, but he was out of humor and spoke
constrainedly.</p>

<p>As Brenda crossed the threshold she saw that the
passage was hung with wreaths and garlands of green
stuff, as if it had been Christmas, and on the walls
she saw slabs of wood on which proverbs and greetings
were done in rough poker work.</p>

<p>“All these Mina and the children have prepared,”
Frau Erdmann pointed out, and then, throwing open
a door, she said in a proud voice, “The dining-room!”</p>

<p>It really was a trying moment for Brenda, who had
thought out her color schemes with the greatest care
and chosen all her furniture in relation to the walls
and carpets she meant to have as a setting. She
wanted a warm glowing dining-room with sun on the
breakfast table, a Persian carpet on the floor and
curtains to go with the tawny pinks of it.</p>

<p>“The dining-room shall be either orange or rose,
according to what I find,” she said to her mother.
“The drawing-room shall be creamy white mostly and
my bedroom green and blue. I know just how it will
all look, and you must soon come to see it.” And
now&mdash;here was the dining-room with the furniture
she had chosen set against walls that looked as if
large brown chenille serpents were crawling over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">1129</a></span>
sickly yellow ground. The ceiling was in heavy
shades of brown and gamboge to match the walls,
and the curtains were of thick chocolate reps with
elaborate upholstered canopies. Even the carpet was
brown, and on the crookedly set dinner table there
was a vase of artificial flowers.</p>

<p>“Very practical,” said the Professor. “Very rich
and elegant, too. Little Mamma has taste. That
one must allow. Elsa wanted light colors here, I
believe, but she need not consider expense at all.
This brown will last a lifetime and does not fade
much. We have it ourselves in our salon.”</p>

<p>He looked like it, thought Brenda, and followed
Frau Erdmann through a communicating door into
the drawing-room, which had been distempered a hard
cold slate, neither blue nor gray.</p>

<p>“This room is not to my taste,” began Frau Erdmann,
and Brenda said unwarily that perhaps it could
be altered and that she had thought of having ivory
white walls. Her Chesterfield and all her big comfortable
easy chairs were covered with an attractive
flowery chintz and she had found some fine pieces of
old furniture for this room, one of which was an
inlaid French cabinet with good-sized drawers.</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of the walls,” said Frau Erdmann.
“The walls are as I chose them, and if they
are not pleasing to you I am sorry. I did my best,
and more than that no one can do. But cotton chair
covers in the salon I should not have advised. In a
bedroom, yes, but in a salon one expects velvet or
brocade. I should also have preferred a suite of new
furniture such as you can buy at several places in
Berlin. Your chairs are a shape that we consider
quite out of fashion and your other pieces do not
match. The chest of drawers would look better in a
bedroom in my opinion, but Elsa seemed to think it
should be placed here. She has some ideas I do not
hold with, but she agrees with me about these cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1130" id="Page_1130">1130</a></span>
covers. I am afraid this room will make a bad impression,
and that is a pity, as you have your way to make
amongst us. People will think that you are trying
to bring over English fashions. Even the Empress
Frederick found that it was a mistake to do that.
We Berliners are quite satisfied with our own taste in
every way.”</p>

<p>Brenda did not reply to this torrent of expostulation,
because her spirits had fallen to zero. She knew
Lothar well enough now to know that he was thoroughly
out of humor. August was eyeing her with
malevolent curiosity, and when the whole party moved
on into her bedroom she hardly knew whether she
wanted to laugh or cry. For here the walls and the
carpet burst upon her in glaring red, a red that was
oppressive and detestable. The windows were tightly
shut, the air smelled stuffily of new wood, new paint
and new blankets, and behind her washstand some one
had hung a great breadth of coarse straw-colored
canvas on which monkeys cut out of black cloth had
been stitched by machine.</p>

<p>“What fascinating monkeys!” said Brenda, going
up to them.</p>

<p>“They are the last word in artistic decoration,”
said August, and Brenda instantly wished they were
not on her walls.</p>

<p>“I hope you are satisfied with everything,” said
Frau Erdmann.</p>

<p>“But, Little Mamma, I am more than satisfied,”
cried Lothar. “When I think of all the trouble you
have saved us and the fatigue you have undergone at
your age, I cannot thank you enough.”</p>

<p>Brenda had gone to one of the windows which she
found looked out at a courtyard, surrounded by tall
houses. She knew enough of Continental life to know
that a room with such an outlook would be noisy all
day and most of the night, and that the only way
of securing privacy was by keeping curtains closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">1131</a></span>
drawn. As she stood there her husband came up to
her and spoke in a low voice that she knew had vials
of wrath behind it.</p>

<p>“My mother is waiting for you to thank her for all
she has done,” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want it done.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you will thank my mother for the
trouble she has taken.”</p>

<p>With mechanical politeness Brenda turned to Frau
Erdmann and said something that might pass for
thanks. The ensuing farewells were strained, and
when the husband and wife were left to themselves
their first words in their future home were words of
discord. Brenda had been trying to make up her mind
to say little or nothing of the vexation she felt, but
Lothar stirred her anger at once.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Frauenlaunen?</i> Women’s whims! I’ve no
patience with them,” he began.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to have told me,” cried Brenda.</p>

<p>“Told you what?”</p>

<p>“Told me that you had commissioned your mother
to take this flat and choose these atrocious papers and
carpets. I could have explained that I wanted to
choose my own.”</p>

<p>“August is right,” said Lothar. “There is too
much ‘my’ in your point of view. This is not your
house. It is mine. You are in it because you are
my wife. If I am satisfied, nothing else matters.”</p>

<p>“I could not live with these walls. I shall have
them all redone at my own expense.”</p>

<p>“You will not have one done. I will not permit
you to waste our joint income in such a senseless way.
You have married a man and not a milksop, and the
sooner you find it out the better.”</p>

<p>“But surely I am to have money of my own. My
father said so.”</p>

<p>“It will be spent as I direct.”</p>

<p>“Well ... I hope we sha’n’t quarrel about money.”</p>
